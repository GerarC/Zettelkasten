# Software Requirement Specification
## 1. Introduction

### Overview
It's needed a software that helps to an auditor to make ISO 27001 auditions, it should be easy to use, good Ui/Ux, and escalable. 

### Business Goal
1. Auditor should register

8. let to the auditor pass a link and a password (generated by the program) to allow to enterprise client verify that data
9. or create a PDF to submit to enterprise client


## 2. Functional Requirement
### User Stories

> [!caution] TODO
> Attach Excel with User Stories

#### Example
|**#**|**Rol**|**Description**|**Objective**|**Acceptance Criteria**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

## 3. Non-Functional Requirement 
> [!caution] TODO
> Create the whole list of functional Requirement

- **Portability:**
	1. The application must be maintainable, if something have to be change, it should be easy to do

## 4. Architecture
> [!caution] TODO
> Create package diagram
