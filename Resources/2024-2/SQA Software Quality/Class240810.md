## Concept of Quality

At the beginning to measure quality the errors were count

- **IEEE:** It's the grade a system fulfills functional requirements and satisfies the user.

## What is Testing

- Analysis
- Test:
- Test Planning
- Test Designe
- Test Execution
- Bug Reporting
- Test Reporting

Those things are to avoid defects and evaluate the product through its requirements

**Test Objectives:**
- Detect flaws

## Organization of SA Tests

**Software Engineer:**
- Analyze
- Model 
- Create
- Proud of their creation

**Also they must:**
- Develop test for individual units (components)

**Â¿When should test begin?**
- Since the project begins, from Analysis and designing.
- Try to break the what engineer created
- QA Eng search fails to avoid client to find them.

**Functional Requirements:** It's functionality of the product, actions. a FR must be clear and concise

There are three environments *Dev*, *QA* and *Prod*:

## Concepts of SQA

**Standards:**
- IEEE, ISO, and other organizations
- They (standards) are adopted voluntarily 

**SQA PLAN:**
- Provides a route map to assuring the Software Quality

**IEEE suggest:**
- Purpose of Scope of the plan

### VeriVal (V&V)
**Verification:**
- Allows through task to verify if a requirement is well implemented
- Requirements oriented and the standards

**Validation:** 
- Another set of task that assure the software is what the user needs
- Business rules (solve the right issue)

**Components of V&V:**
- *Module:* verifies component functions
- *Integration:* how it behave along other components
- *Smoke Test:* verify minimal basic functions of the business
- *Acceptance Test:* validates (with the user) that functionality is right and is what they need.

A requirement must be testable, correct, complete, and precise. Also the designe
