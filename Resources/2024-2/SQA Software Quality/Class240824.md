I.N.V.E.S.T. Principle

### Test and depuration
1. test
2. error detection
3. error fixing
4. re-testing

### Principles
1. **principle:** test process shows the presence of defects not the absence of them.
2. **principle:** It's not possible do exhaustive tests
	- Have a equilibrium between Test everything and don't test anything.
3. **principle:** early testing
	- This diminish costs of errors.
4. **principle:** Defects grouping
	- If there's an error, similar ones should be near.
5. **principle:** Pesticide paradox
6. **principle:** Tests depend on the context
	- Level of test cases tested depends on the level of importance of the problem 
7. **principle:** absence of errors fallacy
	- 
## Test Case definition
- It's a scenery of test that measures the functionality of a group of actions.
- It's destined to test basic task and functions.
- It's a document with steps that should be committed as was planned
- Test cases should se how the thing reacts if there's an scenery of errors
