## Processes:
- OS does a previous work to start a process
- The OS virtualizes (illusion) CPU for the Process.
- Its machine state has the stack pointer


## Time sharing:
- Executing a process, then stop it and to execute another.
- But it has a cost, performance.
- using timer interrupt.
- OS must 

## Kernel:
[Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel)
[Process Management](https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/kernel/processes.html)
- Memory management:
- Process Management: determine which processes can use the cpu, when and how long.
- Device Drivers
- System Calls and security

While Systemd is in charge of initializing processes and managing they in a higher lever, the Kernel determine which process can use the CPU, when and how long can use it.

## Process API:
- Send petitions to the Kernel to create, destroy, wait or other control operations of a Process and its status.

## Stack and Heap:
- each process has those data structures and the OS give to it a place in the main memory.
- the stack saves local variables
- The heap saves variables specifically allocated by the user.
- they are in the same frame and could collide

## Task:
- Search how works the Kernel, Watching that systemd manages the processes.

Virtualization:

Data Structures:
