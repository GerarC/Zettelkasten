# Data Manipulation Language

### DML
 a DML statement is executed when you add, modify or delete rows.


#### Inserting new rows
~~~ sql
insert into <tbl>(**[<attribute>])
values ([<vals>]);
~~~

~~~ sql
-- Example
insert into department(id, name, manager_id, location_id)
values (70, 'public relation', 123, 543);
~~~

you can also add without specifying attributes, You need to give values in the correct order though
~~~ sql
insert into department
values (70, 'public relation', NULL, NULL);
~~~

There are special Values you can use at the moment to insert a new row
~~~ SQL
insert into employees(id, name, last_name, hire_date, job_id)
values (70, 'Valeria', 'Caicedo', SYSDATE, 23043);
~~~

To insert specific dates you could use `TO_DATE`

#### Update
using the update command
~~~ sql
update employees
set department_id = 50
where employee_id = 113;
~~~

It's almost mandatory use `where` because is dangerous.
~~~ sql
-- Danger
update copy_emp
set department_id = 110;
~~~

You can use subqueries

~~~ sql
update copy_emp
set department_id = (
	select department_id
	from employees
	where employee_id = 100
)
where job_id = (
	select job_id
	from employees
	where employee_id = 200
);
~~~

#### Delete
~~~ sql
delete from deparments
where deparment_name = 'finance';
~~~

~~~ sql
delete from copy_emp;
~~~

~~~ SQL
delete from employes
where department_id = (
	select department_id
	from departments
	where deparment_name like '%Public%'
);
~~~

#### Truncate
Removes all rows from the table, leaving it empty.
~~~ sql
truncate table table_name;
~~~

### Database Transactions
A *transaction* consists of one of: DML statements, One DDL (DATA Definition Language) statement or a data control language (DCL) statement.

It begins when the first DML statement is executed and ends when there is a commit or rollback, a DDL or DCL statement executes, the user exits SQL Developer or the system crashes.
