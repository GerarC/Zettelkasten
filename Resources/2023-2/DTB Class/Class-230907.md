# Select queries

~~~ sql

~~~

Select all items and columns
~~~ sql
select * from <table>;
~~~

Select some columns
~~~ sql
select <column1>, <column2> from <table>
~~~

Select is basically a calculator, you can operate columns:
~~~ sql
select 2*(<column>+ 2) from <table>;
~~~

You can give alias to column with the next commands
~~~ sql
select <column> as <alias> from <table>
select <column> "<alias>" from <table>
~~~

you can blend columns using double pipe:
~~~ sql
select <column1>||<column2> as <alias> from <table>
~~~

Obviously Select can also be used with `where`.
    
You can use a query to create a new table
~~~
create table <alias> as
	select <columns><operation>
	from <table1>
	where <condition>
 ~~~
Where has a lot of conditions
and put an ordering type with `order by`


And you can use distinct
