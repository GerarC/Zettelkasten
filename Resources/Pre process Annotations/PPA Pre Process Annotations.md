# Thermodynamic Physics

Stationary flow Devices:
- A lot of devices used in engineering.
- Energy conservation
- Mass conservation
- Mass flow

$Q_{in} + W_{in} + m_{in}(h_{in} + V_{in}²/2 + gZ_{in}) = Q_{out} + W_{out} + m_{out}(h_{out} + V_{out}²/2 + gZ_{out})$

Nozzle and Diffuse:
- Nozzle augment Mass flow velocity.
- Diffuse decrease Mass flow velocity.
- Energy equation for this type of devices $Q_{in} + m_{in}(h_{in} + V_{in}²/2) = Q_{out} + m_{out}(h_{out} + V_{out}²/2)$

Turbine and Compressor:
- Turbine increases potency decreasing the pressure
- Compressor increases pressure losing potency.


Blend Chamber:
- mix a two fluids into a new one.
