## Chapter 1: Units, Physical Quantities, and Vectors
### 1.1 Nature of physics
No theory is ever regarded as the final or ultimate truth. The possibility al- ways exists that new observations will require that a theory be revised or discarded. It is in the nature of physical theory that we can disprove a theory by  finding behavior that is inconsistent with it, but we can never prove that a theory is always correct. *Page 27*

### 1.2 Solving physics problems

You may find it useful to remember the acronym **I SEE**—short for *Identify*, *Set up*, *Execute*, and *Evaluate* *Page 28*

### 1.3 Standards and Units
To make accurate, reliable measurements, we need units of measurement  that do not change and that can be duplicated by observers in various locations.  The system of units used by scientists and engineers around the world is commonly called “the metric system,” but since 1960 it has been known officially as  the **International System**, or **SI** (the abbreviation for its French name, *Système  International*). Appendix A gives a list of all SI units as well as definitions of the most fundamental units. *Page 29*

#### Time 
It is based on an atomic clock, which uses the energy difference between  the two lowest energy states of the cesium atom (133Cs). When bombarded by  microwaves of precisely the proper frequency, cesium atoms undergo a transition from one of these states to the other. One **second** (abbreviated s) is defined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 cycles of this microwave radiation. *Page 29*

#### Length
Hence the new definition if the **meter** (abbreviated m) is the distance that light travels in vacuum in 1>299,792,458 second. This modern definition provides a much more precise standard of length than the one based on a wave-length of light. *Page 30*

#### Mass
The standard of mass, the **kilogram** (abbreviated kg), is defined to be the mass of  a particular cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept at the International Bureau  of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, near Paris. An atomic standard  of mass would be more fundamental, but at present we cannot measure masses  on an atomic scale with as much accuracy as on a macroscopic scale. The *gram* (which is not a fundamental unit) is 0.001 kilogram. *Page 30*


### 1.4 Using and Converting Units
An equation must always be dimensionally consistent. You can’t add apples  and automobiles; two terms may be added or equated only if they have the same  units. For example, if a body moving with constant speed v travels a distance d in a time t, these quantities are related by the equation *Page 31*

Always use units in calculations Make it a habit to always write  numbers with the correct units and carry the units through the calculation as in the  example above. This provides a very useful check. If at some stage in a calculation  you find that an equation or an expression  has inconsistent units, you know you have  made an error. *Page 31*

### 1.5 Uncertainty and Significant Figures
The distinction between the measurements with a ruler and with a caliper is in their **uncertainty**; the measurement with a caliper has a smaller uncertainty. The uncertainty is also called the **error** because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value. The uncertainty or error of a measured value depends on the measurement technique used. *Page 33*

In many cases the uncertainty of a number is not stated explicitly. Instead, the uncertainty is indicated by the number of meaningful digits, or **significant  figures**, in the measured value. We gave the thickness of the cover of the book as 2.91 mm, which has three significant figures. By this we mean that the first two digits are known to  be correct, while the third digit is uncertain. *Page 33*

When you use numbers that have uncertainties to compute other numbers, the  computed numbers are also uncertain. When numbers are multiplied or divided,  the result can have no more significant figures than the factor with the fewest significant figures has. For example, 3.1416 * 2.34 * 0.58 = 4.3. When we add and subtract numbers, it’s the location of the decimal point that matters, not the number of significant figures. For example, 123.62 + 8.9 = 132.5. *Page 33*

### 1.6 Estimates and Orders of Magnitude
I don't care.

### 1.7 Vectors
Some physical quantities, such as time, temperature, mass, and density, can be described completely by a single number with a unit. But many other important quantities in physics have a direction associated with them and cannot be described by a single number.

When a physical quantity is described by a single number, we call it a scalar quantity. In contrast, a vector quantity has both a magnitude (the “how much” or “how big” part) and a direction in space.

We usually represent a vector quantity such as displacement by a single letter, such as $\vec{A}$

We usually represent the magnitude of a vector quantity by the same letter used for the vector, but in lightface italic type with no arrow on top.

### 1.8 Components of Vectors
 
$\frac{Ax}{A} = \cos\theta$ and $\frac{Ay}{A} = \sin\theta$
 
$Ax = A \cos\theta$ and $Ay = A \sin\theta$

 ![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 1.3.png]]

### 1.9 Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1, with no units. Its only purpose is to point—that is, to describe a direction in space. Unit vectors provide a convenient notation for many expressions involving components of vectors. We will always include a caret, or “hat” (^), in the symbol for a unit vector to distinguish it from ordinary vectors whose magnitude may or may not be equal to 1.

In an xy-coordinate system we can define a unit vector $\hat{i}$ that points in the direction of the positive x-axis and a unit vector $\hat{j}$ that points in the direction of the positive y-axis.

$\vec{A} = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j}$

### 1.10 Product of Vectors
**Scalar Product**
We denote the scalar product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ by $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$. Because of this notation, the scalar product is also called the dot product. Although $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are vectors, the quantity $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$ is a scalar.  

$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = AB\cos\phi = \vec{A}\vec{B}\cos\phi$
or
$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = A_xB_x + A_y+B_y + A_zB_z$


**Vector Product**
We denote the vector product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, also called the cross product, by $\vec{A}\times\vec{B}$. As the name suggests, the vector product is itself a vector.

$C = AB\sin\phi$
or
$C_x = A_yB_z - A_zB_y \qquad C_y = A_zB_x - A_xB_z \qquad C_z = A_xB_y - A_yB_x$

## Chapter 2: Motion Along the Straight Line
### 2.1 Displacement, Time and Average Velocity
 
$\Delta x = x-2 - x-1$

**Average Velocity**
$v_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_2}$

### 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity

$v_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$

### 2.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration
Just as velocity describes the rate of change of position with time, acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity with time. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector quantity. 

$a_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

**Instantaneous Acceleration**
$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}$

### 2.4 Motion With constant Acceleration
The simplest kind of accelerated motion is straight-line motion with constant acceleration. In this case the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the motion. As an example, a falling body has a constant acceleration if the effects of the air are not important.

$a_x = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

$v_x = v_{0x} + a_xt$

$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$

$t = \frac{v_x - v_{0x}}{a_x}$

$v_x^2 = v_{0x}^2 + 2a_x(\Delta x)$

$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_{0x} + v_x)t$

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 2.1.png]]

### 2.5 Free Falling Bodies
The most familiar example of motion with (nearly) constant acceleration is a body falling under the influence of the earth’s gravitational attraction. Such motion has held the attention of philosophers and scientists since ancient times. In the fourth century b.c., Aristotle thought (erroneously) that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies, in proportion to their weight. Nineteen centuries later, Galileo (see Section 1.1) argued that a body should fall with a downward acceleration that is constant and independent of its weight.

The constant acceleration of a freely falling body is called the acceleration due to gravity, and we denote its magnitude with the letter g. We will frequently use the approximate value of g at or near the earth’s surface:
$g = 9.80m/s^2$

## 3 Motions in Two or Three Dimensions
### 3.1 Position and Velocity Vectors
Let’s see how to describe a particle’s motion in space. If the particle is at a point P  at a certain instant, the position vector $\vec{r}$ of the particle at this instant is a vector that goes from the origin of the coordinate system to point P (Fig. 3.1 on next page). The Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z of point P are the x-, y-, and z-components of Vector $\vec{r}$

$\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$

$\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$

### 3.2 The Acceleration Vector

$\vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$

### 3.3 Projectile Motion
A projectile is any body that is given an initial velocity and then follows a path determined entirely by the effects of gravitational acceleration and air resistance. A batted baseball, a thrown football, and a bullet shot from a rifle are all projectiles. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory

**Horizontal movement**
$a_x = 0$
$v_x = v_{0x}$
$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t$

**Vertical movement**
$a_y = -g$
$v_y = v_{0y} - gt$
$y = y_0 + v_{0y}t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

**Velocity Components**
$v_{0x} = v_0\cos\alpha_0  \qquad v_{0y} = v_0\sin\alpha_0$

now
$x = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)t$
$v_{x} = v_0\cos\alpha_0$

$y = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
$v_{y} = v_0\sin\alpha_0 - gt$

$\tan\alpha = \frac{v_y}{v_x}$

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 3.1.png]]

### 3.4 Motion in a Circle
When a particle moves along a curved path, the direction of its velocity changes. As we saw in Section 3.2, this means that the particle must have a component of acceleration perpendicular to the path, even if its speed is constant (see Fig. 3.11b).

**Uniform Circular Motion**
When a particle moves in a circle with constant speed, the motion is called uniform circular motion.

$a_{rad} = a_n = \frac{v^2}{R}$

$v = \frac{2\pi R}{T}$
$a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

the total acceleration is:
$a = \sqrt{a_{rad}^2 + a_{tan}^2}$

**Nonuniform Circular Motion**
In nonuniform circular motion there is also a component of acceleration that is parallel to the instantaneous velocity. Here we call this component $a_{tan}$  

### 3.5 Relative Velocity
Relative velocity: When a body P moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $B$, and $B$ moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $A$, we denote the velocity of $P$ relative to $B$ by $\vec{v}_{P/B}$, the velocity of $P$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{P/A}$, and the velocity of $B$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{B/A}$. If these velocities are all along the same line, their components along that line are related by Eq. (3.32). More generally, these velocities are related by Eq.

$v_{P/A-x} = v_{P/B-x} + v_{B/A-x}$
(relative velocity along a line)

$\vec{v}_{P/A} = \vec{v}_{P/B} + \vec{v}_{B/A}$
(relative velocity in space)

![[MPS Relative Velocity Diagram.png]]

## 4 Newton's Laws of Motion
### 4.1 Force and Interaction
a force is a push or a pull. A better definition is that a force is an interaction between two bodies or between a body and its environment. That’s why we always refer to the force that one body exerts on a second body.

To describe a force vector $\vec{F}$, we need to describe the direction in which it acts as well as its magnitude, the quantity that describes “how much” or “how hard” the force pushes or pulls. The SI unit of the magnitude of force is the newton, abbreviated N.

**Superposition of Forces**
When you throw a ball, at least two forces act on it: the push of your hand and the downward pull of gravity. Experiment shows that when two forces $\vec{F}_1$ and $\vec{F}_2$ act at the same time at the same point on a body, the effect on the body’s motion is the same as if a single force $\vec{R}$ were acting equal to the vector sum, or resultant, of the original forces: $\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2$. More generally, any number of forces applied at a point on a body have the same effect as a single force equal to the vector sum of the forces. This important principle is called superposition of forces.

### Newton's First Law
**Newton's First Law of Motion:** A body acted on by no net force has a constant velocity (which may be zero) and zero acceleration.

The tendency of a body to keep moving once it is set in motion is called **inertia**.

It’s important to note that the net force is what matters in Newton’s first law. For example, a physics book at rest on a horizontal tabletop has two forces acting on it: an upward supporting force, or normal force, exerted by the tabletop (see Fig. 4.2a) and the downward force of the earth’s gravity (which acts even if the tabletop is elevated above the ground;

When a body is either at rest or moving with constant velocity (in a straight line with constant speed), we say that the body is in equilibrium. For a body to be in equilibrium, it must be acted on by no forces, or by several forces such that their vector sum—that is, the net force—is zero:
$\sum\vec{F}=0$

The point is that the bus is accelerating with respect to the earth and is not a suitable frame of reference for Newton’s first law. This law is valid in some frames of reference and not valid in others. A frame of reference in which Newton’s first law is valid is called an inertial frame of reference. The earth is at least approximately an inertial frame of reference, but the bus is not. (The earth is not a completely inertial frame, owing to the acceleration associated with its rotation and its motion around the sun. These effects are quite small, however) Because Newton’s first law is used to define what we mean by an inertial frame of reference, it is sometimes called the law of inertia.

### 4.3 Newton's Second Law

**Mass and Force**
Our results mean that for a given body, the ratio of the magnitude $|\sum\vec{F}|$ of the net force to the magnitude $a=|\vec{a}|$ of the acceleration is constant, regardless of the magnitude of net force. We call this ratio the **inertial mass**, or simply the **mass**, of the body and denote it by *m*. That is,
$$m = \sum\frac{|\vec{F}|}{a} \quad or \quad |\vec{F}|=ma \quad or \quad a = \frac{|\vec{F}|}{m}$$
The SI unit of mass is the kilogram. We mentioned in Section 1.3 that the kilogram is officially defined to be the mass of a cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept in a vault near Paris (Fig. 1.4). We can use this standard kilogram, along with Eqs. (4.4), to define the newton: One newton is the amount of net force that gives an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared to a body with a mass of 1 kilogram.
$$1N = 1kg\cdot m/s^2$$

**Stating Newton’s Second Law**
Newton's Second Law of Motion: If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. The mass of the body times the acceleration vector of the body equals the net force vector.

In symbols,
$\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$

>[!Note]
The force is also defined as the change of momentum in a time.
$\large\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$
>**From:**[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)

**Using Newton’s Second Law**
Usually we will use it in component form, with a separate equation for each component of force and the corresponding component of acceleration:
$\sum F_x = ma_x \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x$

Second, the statement of Newton’s second law refers to external forces. It’s impossible for a body to affect its own motion by exerting a force on itself;

like the first law. Thus it is not valid in the reference frame of any of the accelerating vehicles in Fig. 4.10

### 4.4 Mass and Weight
Mass characterizes the inertial properties of a body. Mass is what keeps the china on the table when you yank the tablecloth out from under it. The greater the mass, the greater the force needed to cause a given acceleration; this is reflected in Newton’s second law, $\sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$.
Weight, on the other hand, is a force exerted on a body by the pull of the earth. Mass and weight are related: Bodies that have large mass also have large weight. A large stone is hard to throw because of its large mass, and hard to lift off the ground because of its large weight.
$\vec{w}=m\vec{g}$

### 4.5 Newton's Third Law
Newton's Third Law of Motion: If body A exerts a force on body B (an “action”), then body B exerts a force on body A (a “reaction”). These two forces have the same magnitude but are opposite in direction. These two forces act on different bodies.
$\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$
It doesn’t matter whether one body is inanimate

### 4.6 Free-Body Diagrams
Newton’s three laws of motion contain all the basic principles we need to solve a wide variety of problems in mechanics. These laws are very simple in form, but the process of applying them to specific situations can pose real challenges. In this brief section we’ll point out three key ideas and techniques to use in any problems involving Newton’s laws. You’ll learn others in Chapter 5, which also extends the use of Newton’s laws to cover more complex situations.
 1. Newton’s first and second laws apply to a specific body. Whenever you use Newton’s first law, $\sum\vec{F}=0$, for an equilibrium situation or Newton’s second law, $\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$, for a non-equilibrium situation, you must decide at the beginning to which body you are referring. This decision may sound trivial, but it isn’t.
 2. Only forces acting on the body matter. The sum $\sum\vec{F}$ includes all the forces that act on the body in question. Hence, once you’ve chosen the body to analyze, you have to identify all the forces acting on it. Don’t confuse the forces acting on a body with the forces exerted by that body on some other body. For example, to analyze a person walking, you would include in $\sum\vec{F}$ the force that the ground exerts on the person as he walks, but not the force that the person exerts on the ground (Fig. 4.28). These forces form an action–reaction pair and are related by Newton’s third law, but only the member of the pair that acts on the body you’re working with goes into $\sum\vec{F}$.
 3. Free-body diagrams are essential to help identify the relevant forces. A free-body diagram shows the chosen body by itself, “free” of its surroundings, with vectors drawn to show the magnitudes and directions of all the forces that act on the body. We’ve already shown free-body diagrams in Figs. 4.17, 4.18, 4.20, and 4.25a. Be careful to include all the forces acting on the body, but be equally careful not to include any forces that the body exerts on any other body. In particular, the two forces in an action–reaction pair must never appear in the same free-body diagram because they never act on the same body. Furthermore, never include forces that a body exerts on itself, since these can’t affect the body’s motion.

When a problem involves more than one body, you have to take the problem apart and draw a separate free-body diagram for each body.

### 5.3 Friction Forces
Friction is important in many aspects of everyday life. The oil in a car engine minimizes friction between moving parts, but without friction between the tires and the road we couldn’t drive or turn the car.

**Kinetic and static Friction**
First, when a body rests or slides on a surface, we can think of the surface as exerting a single contact force on the body, with force components perpendicular and parallel to the surface (Fig. 5.17). The perpendicular component vector is the normal force, denoted by $\vec{n}$. The component vector parallel to the surface (and perpendicular to $\vec{n}$) is the friction force, denoted by $\vec{f}$. If the surface is frictionless, then $\vec{f}$ is zero but there is still a normal force.

The kind of friction that acts when a body slides over a surface is called a **kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$**. The adjective “kinetic” and the subscript “$k$” remind us that the two surfaces are moving relative to each other. The magnitude of the kinetic friction force usually increases when the normal force increases. This is why it takes more force to slide a full box of books across the floor than an empty one.
In many cases the magnitude of the kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$ is found experimentally to be approximately proportional to the magnitude n of the normal force:
$$f_k = \mu_kn$$

>[!warning] CAUTION
>Friction and normal forces are always perpendicular Remember that Eq. (5.3) is not a vector equation because $\vec{f}_k$ and $\vec{n}$ are always perpendicular. Rather, it is a scalar relationship between the magnitudes of the two forces.

Friction forces may also act when there is no relative motion. If you try to slide a box across the floor, the box may not move at all because the floor exerts an equal and opposite friction force on the box. This is called a **static friction force $\vec{f}_s$**.    
![[MPS Frictions.png]]

$f_s \le (f_S)_{max} = \mu_sn$

### 5.4 Dynamics of Circular Motion
We can also express the centripetal acceleration $a_{rad}$ in terms of the period $T$, the time for one revolution:
 
$\large T = \frac{2\pi R}{v}$ -> replacing in $a_{rad}=\frac{v^2}{R}$

$a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

The magnitude of the radial acceleration is given by arad = v2>R, so the magnitude Fnet of the net force on a particle with mass m in uniform circular motion must be
$F_{net} = ma_{rad} = m \frac{v^2}{R}$

Uniform circular motion can result from any combination of forces, just so the net force $\sum\vec{F}$ is always directed toward the center of the circle and has a constant magnitude. Note that the body need not move around a complete circle: is valid for any path that can be regarded as part of a circular arc.
## 6 Work And Kinetic Energy
### 6.1 Work
The physicist’s definition of work is based on these observations. Consider a body that undergoes a displacement of magnitude s along a straight line. (For now, we’ll assume that any body we discuss can be treated as a particle so that we can ignore any rotation or changes in shape of the body.) While the body moves, a constant force $\vec{F}$ acts on it in the same direction as the displacement $\vec{s}$. We define the work W done by this constant force under these circumstances as the product of the force magnitude $F$ and the displacement magnitude $s$:
$W = Fs$

The SI unit of work is the joule (abbreviated J, pronounced “jool,” and named in honor of the 19th-century English physicist James Prescott Joule). From Eq. (6.1) we see that in any system of units, the unit of work is the unit of force multiplied by the unit of distance. In SI units the unit of force is the newton and the unit of distance is the meter, so 1 joule is equivalent to $1\space\text{newton-meter}$ ($N \cdot m$): $1\space joule = (1\space newton)(1\space meter) \quad or \quad 1 J = 1\ N \cdot m$

But what if the person pushes at an angle f to the car’s displacement? Then $\vec{F}$ has a component $F_\parallel = F\cos\phi$ in the direction of the displacement $\vec{s}$ and a component $F_\perp = F\sin\phi$ that acts perpendicular to $\vec{s}$.

Only the parallel component $F_\parallel$ is effective in moving the car, so we define the work as the product of this force component and the magnitude of the displacement. Hence $W = F_\parallel s = (F\cos\phi)s$
$W = Fs\cos\phi$

has the form of the scalar product of two vectors: $W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{s}$

#### Work: positive, negative, or Zero
When the force has a component in the same direction as the displacement ($\phi$ between $0°$ and $90°$), $\cos\phi$ in Eq. Is positive and the work W is *positive*. When the force has a component opposite to the displacement ($\phi$ between $90°$ and $180°$), $\cos\phi$ is negative and the work is *negative*. When the force is perpendicular to the displacement, $\phi = 90°$ and the work done by the force is *zero*.

#### Total Work
How do we calculate work when several forces act on a body? One way is to use (6.2) or (6.3) to compute the work done by each separate force. Then, because work is a scalar quantity, the total work Wtot done on the body by all the forces is the algebraic sum of the quantities of work done by the individual forces. An alternative way to find the total work Wtot is to compute the vector sum of the  forces (that is, the net force) and then use this vector sum.

### 6.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem
In Eq. (6.4) the product Fs is the work done by the net force F and thus is equal to the total work $W_{tot}$ done by all the forces acting on the particle. The quantity $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is called the kinetic energy K of the particle:
$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
Where K is the Kinetic Energy.

We can now interpret Eq. (6.4) in terms of work and kinetic energy. The first term on the right side of Eq. (6.4) is $K_2=\frac{1}{2}mv^2_2$, the final kinetic energy of the particle (that is, after the displacement). The second term is the initial kinetic energy, $K_1=\frac{1}{2}mv^2_1$, and the difference between these terms is the change in kinetic energy. So:
$W_{tot} = K_2 - K_2 = \Delta K$

From Eq. (6.4) or Eq. (6.6), kinetic energy and work must have the same units. Hence the joule is the SI unit of both work and kinetic energy (and, as we will see later, of all kinds of energy). To verify this, note that in SI the quantity $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$

Because we used Newton’s laws in deriving the work–energy theorem, we can use this theorem only in an inertial frame of reference. Note that the work–energy theorem is valid in any inertial frame, but the values of Wtot and $K_2 - K_1$ may  differ from one inertial frame to another (because the displacement and speed of a  body may be different in different frames).

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 6.2.png]]

#### The Meaning of Kinetic Energy
Gives insight into the physical meaning of kinetic energy. The hammerhead is dropped from rest, and its kinetic energy when it hits the I-beam equals the total work done on it up to that point by the net force. This result is true in general: To accelerate a particle of mass m from rest (zero kinetic energy) up to a speed v, the total work done on it must equal the change in kinetic energy from zero to $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$:
$W_{tot} = K - 0 = K$


So the kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the total work that was done to accelerate it from rest to its present speed (Fig. 6.13). The definition $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, wasn’t chosen at random; it’s the only definition that agrees with this interpretation of kinetic energy.

This gives us another interpretation of kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the total work that particle can do in the process of being brought to rest. 
 
#### Work and Kinetic Energy in Composite Systems
the total kinetic energy of such a system can 
change even when no work is done on any part of the system by anything outside it.


### 6.3 Work And Energy With Varying Energy
Fortunately, the work–energy theorem holds true even when forces are varying and when the body’s path is not straight.

#### Work Done by a Varying Force, Straight-Line Motion
The work done by the force in the total displacement 
from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is approximately
$W = F_{ax} \Delta x_a + F_{bx} \Delta x_b + ...$

In the limit that the number of segments becomes very large and the width of each becomes very small, this sum becomes the integral: $W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_xdx$

When the force is Constant
$W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_xdx \quad=\quad F_x\int_{x_1}^{x_2}dx \quad =\quad F_x(x_2-x_1)$ 

the force we apply to the right-hand end has an x-component directly proportional to x:
$F_x = kx$ (force required to stretch a spring) 
where $k$ is a constant called the force constant (or spring constant) of the spring. The units of k are force divided by distance: $N/m$ in SI units.

The observation that force is directly proportional to elongation for elongations that are not too great was made by Robert Hooke in 1678 and is known as Hooke’s law. It really shouldn’t be called a “law,” since it’s a statement about a specific device and not a fundamental law of nature. 

The force at the moving end does do work. Figure 6.19 is a graph of Fx as a function of x, the elongation of the spring. The work done by this force when the elongation goes from zero to a maximum value X is
$W = \int^X_0F_x\space dx = \int^X_0 kx\space dx = \frac{1}{2}kX^2$

$W=\frac{1}{2}(X)(kX)=\frac{1}{2}kX^2$

$W = \frac{1}{2}kx_2^2-\frac{1}{2}kx_1^2$

### 6.4 Power
The definition of work makes no reference to the passage of time. If you lift a barbell weighing 100 N through a vertical distance of 1.0 m at constant velocity, you do 1100 N211.0 m2 = 100 J of work whether it takes you 1 second, 1 hour, or 1 year to do it.

Power is the time rate at which work is done. Like work and energy, 
power is a scalar quantity.
$P_{av} = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$
$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$

The SI unit of power is the watt (W), named for the English inventor James Watt. One watt equals 1 joule per second: $1 W = 1 J/s$ 

Also can be seen as:
$P = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}$


## 7 Potential Energy And Energy Conservation
### 7.1 Gravitational Potential
In many situations it seems as though energy has been stored in a system, to be recovered later.

For this reason, energy associated with position is called potential energy. The potential energy associated with a body’s weight and its height above the ground is called gravitational potential energy.

The other way is to say that the kinetic energy increases as the gravitational potential energy decreases.

$W_{grav} = Fs = w(y_1 - y_2) = mgy_1 - mgy_2$

In that case the quantity $(y_1 - y_2)$ is negative, and 
$W_{grav}$ is negative because the weight and displacement are opposite in direction.

$U_{grav} = mgy$ where $U$ is the letter with we symbolized Potential Energy.

$W_{grav} = U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2} = -\Delta U_{grav}$

The negative sign in front of $\Delta U_{grav}$ is essential. When the body moves up, y increases, the work done by the gravitational force is negative, and the gravitational potential energy increases $(\Delta U_{grav} < 0)$. When the body moves down, y decreases, the gravitational force does positive work, and the gravitational potential energy decreases $(\Delta U_{grav} > 0)$. 

#### Conservation of Mechanical Energy  (Gravitational Forces only)
The work–energy theorem, Eq. (6.6), says that the total work done on the body equals the change in the body’s kinetic energy: $W_{tot} = \Delta K = K_2 - K_1$. If gravity is the only force that acts, then from Eq. (7.3), $W_{tot} = W_{grav} = - \Delta U_{grav} = U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2}$.

$\Delta K = -\Delta U_{grav}$
Rewrited:
$K_1 + U_{grav,\space 1} = K_2 +j U_{grav,\space 2}$

The sum of $K + U_{grav}$ is called E, the total mechanical energy of the system. By “system” we mean the body of mass m and the earth considered together

Then $E_1 = K_1 + U_{grav,\space 1}$ is the total mechanical energy at $y_1$ and $E_2 = K_2 + U_{grav,\space 2}$ is the total mechanical energy at $y_2$.
$E_1 = E_2$. That is, $E$ is constant

then:
$E = K + U_{grav} = \text{\large cte}$.

#### When Forces other than Gravity Do Work
$W_{other} + W_{grav} = K_2 - K_1$ 
$W_{other} + U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2} = K_2 - K_1$

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 7.1.png]]

### 7.2 Elastic Potential Energy
In many situations we encounter potential energy that is not gravitational in nature. 
$F = kx$

We found in Section 6.3 that the work we must do on the spring to move one end from an elongation $x_1$ to a different elongation $x_2$ is:
$W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2_2 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2_1$ (work done on a spring)

we find that in a displacement from $x_1$ to $x_2$ the spring does an amount of work $W_el$ given by:
$W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2_1 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2_2$ (work done by a spring)
The subscript “el” stands for elastic.

we define it to be the elastic potential energy:
$U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

So
$W_{el} = - \Delta U_{el} = U_{el,\space 1} - U_{el,\space 2}$

$K_1 + U_{el,\space 1} = K_2 + U_{el,\space 2}$

#### Situations With Both Gravitational And Elastic Potential Energy

If $W_{tot} = W_{grav} + W_{el} + W_{other}$. The work-energy theorem then give $W_{tot} = W_{grav} + W_{el} + W_{other} = K_2 - K_1$

In General: $K_1 + U_1 + W_{other} = K_2 + U_2$

### 7.3 Conservative And Non-Conservative Forces
#### Conservative Forces
A force that offers this opportunity of two-way conversion between kinetic and potential energies is called a conservative force. We have seen two examples of conservative forces: the gravitational force and the spring force.

Anything that we deposit in the energy “bank” can later be withdrawn 
without loss. Another important aspect of conservative forces is that if a body follows different paths from point 1 to point 2, the work done by a conservative force is the same for all of these paths

In summary, the work done by a conservative force has four properties:
1. It can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final values of a potential-energy function.
2. It is reversible.
3. It is independent of the path of the body and depends on only the starting and ending points.
4. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero.

#### Non-Conservative Forces
Not all forces are conservative. Consider the friction force.

The lost kinetic energy can’t be recovered by reversing the motion or in any other way, and mechanical energy is not conserved. So there is no potential-energy function for the friction force.

A force that is not conservative is called a nonconservative force. The work done by a nonconservative force cannot be represented by a potential-energy function. Some nonconservative forces, like kinetic friction or fluid resistance, cause mechanical energy to be lost or dissipated; a force of this kind is called a dissipative force. There are also nonconservative forces that increase mechanical energy. 

#### The Law Of Conservation Of Energy
Nonconservative forces cannot be represented in terms of potential energy. But we can describe the effects of these forces in terms of kinds of energy other than kinetic or potential energy. 

The energy associated with this change in the state of the materials is called internal energy. 


### 7.4 Force And Potential Energy

$F_x(x)\Delta x = -\Delta U$ and $F_x(x) = - \Large{\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x}}$

$F_x(x) = - \Large{\frac{dU(x)}{dx}}$

## 8 Momentum, Impulse And Collisions
#### Newton's Second Law in Terms of Momentum
Newton’s second law says that the net force $\sum\vec{F}$ acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of the product of the particle’s mass and velocity. We’ll call this product the momentum, or linear momentum, of the particle:
$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$

The greater the mass m and speed v of a particle, the greater is its magnitude of momentum mv. Keep in mind that momentum is a vector quantity with the same direction as the particle’s velocity

As $\sum\vec{F} =\Large\frac{md\vec{v}}{dt}$ and $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$  then:
$\sum\vec{F} = \Large{\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}}$

The net force (vector sum of all forces) acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of momentum of the particle. This is the form in which Newton originally stated his second law (although he called momentum the “quantity of motion”).

#### The Impulse–Momentum Theorem
The impulse of the net force, denoted by $\vec{J}$, is defined to be the product of the net force and the time interval:

$\vec{J} = \sum\vec{F}(t_2 - t_1) = \sum\vec{F}\Delta t$

$\vec{J} = \vec{p} - \vec{p} = \Delta\vec{p}$

$\vec{J} = \int^{t_2}_{t_1}\sum\vec{F}dt$

### 8.2 Conservation of Momentum
The concept of momentum is particularly important in situations in which we have two or more bodies that interact.

The net force on particle A is $\vec{F}_{B\space on\space A}$ and the net force on particle B is $\vec{F}_{A\space on\space B}$, so from Eq. (8.4) the rates of change of the momenta of the two particles are

$\vec{F}_{B\space on\space A} = \Large\frac{d\vec{p}_A}{dt}$  $\vec{F}_{A\space on\space B} = \Large\frac{d\vec{p}_B}{dt}$

$\vec{F}_{B\space on\space A} + \vec{F}_{A\space on\space B} = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt} = 0$

$\vec{P} = \vec{p}_A + \vec{p}_B$

If the vector sum of the external forces on a system is zero, the total momentum of the system is constant.
that act between members of the system. This means that we can apply conservation of momentum even if (as is often the case) we know very little about the internal forces. We have used Newton’s second law to derive this principle, so we have to be careful to use it only in inertial frames of reference.


![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 8.1.png]]

### 8.3 Momentum Conservation And Collisions
If the forces between the colliding bodies are much larger than any external forces, as is the case in most collisions, we can ignore the external forces and treat the bodies as an isolated system. Then momentum is conserved and the total momentum of the system has the same value before and after the collision.

#### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions
If the forces between the bodies are also conservative, so no mechanical energy is lost or gained in the collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is the same after the collision as before. Such a collision is called an elastic collision. 

A collision in which the total kinetic energy after the collision is less than before the collision is called an inelastic collision.

An inelastic collision in which the colliding bodies stick together and move as one body after the collision is called a completely inelastic collision.

#### Completely inelastic Collisions
Because the two bodies stick together after the collision, they have the same final velocity $\vec{v}_2$:
$\vec{v}_{A2} = \vec{v}_{B2} = \vec{v}_{2}$

Conservation of momentum gives the relationship
$m_A\vec{v}_{A1} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1} = (m_A + m_B)\vec{v}_{2}$

If B is initially at rest
$v_{2x} = \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}v_{A1x}$

The ratio of final to initial kinetic energy is
$\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}$

#### Classifying Collisions
It’s important to remember that we can classify collisions according to energy considerations. A collision in which kinetic energy is conserved is called elastic. 

Finally, we emphasize again that we can sometimes use momentum conservation even when external forces are acting on the system, if the net external force acting on the colliding bodies is small in comparison with the internal forces during the collision.

### 8.4 Elastic Collisions
When two billiard balls collide, they squash a little near the surface of contact, but then they spring back. Some of the kinetic energy is stored temporarily as elastic potential energy, but at the end it is reconverted to kinetic energy.

Let’s look at a one-dimensional elastic collision between two bodies A and B.
From conservation of kinetic energy we have:
$\frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A1x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B1x}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A2x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}^2$
and conservation of momentum gives:
$m_A\vec{v}_{A1x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1x} = m_A\vec{v}_{A2x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}$

#### Elastic Collisions, One Body Initially at Rest
The general solution to the above equations is a little complicated, so we will concentrate on the particular case in which body B is at rest before the collision (so vB1x = 0).
$\frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A1x}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A2x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}^2$
$m_A\vec{v}_{A1x} = m_A\vec{v}_{A2x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}$

With this we obtain
$v_{B2x} = v_{A1x} + v_{A2x}$

$v_{A2x} = \frac{m_A - m_B}{m_A + m_B}v_{A1x}$
$v_{B2x} = \frac{2m_A}{m_A + m_B}$

### 8.5 Center Of Mass
We can restate the principle of conservation of momentum in a useful way by using the concept of center of mass. Suppose we have several particles with masses $m_1$, $m_2$, and so on. Let the coordinates of $m_1$ be $(x_1 , y_1)$, those of $m_2$ be $(x_2 , y_2)$, and so on. We define the center of mass of the system as the point that has coordinates $(x_{cm}, y_{cm})$ given by

$x_{cm} = \Large\frac{m_1x_1 \space +\space m_2x_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_ix_i}{m_1 \space +\space m_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i} = \frac{\sum_i m_ix_i}{\sum_i m_i}$
$y_{cm} = \Large\frac{m_1y_1 \space +\space m_2y_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_iy_i}{m_1 \space +\space m_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i} = \frac{\sum_i m_iy_i}{\sum_i m_i}$

$\vec{r}_{cm} = \Large\frac{m_1\vec{r}_1 \space +\space m_2\vec{r}_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i\vec{r}_i}{m_1 \space +\space m_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i} = \frac{\sum_i m_i\vec{r}_i}{\sum_i m_i}$

#### Motion Of The Center Of Mass
$\vec{v}_{cm} = \Large\frac{m_1\vec{v}_1 \space +\space m_2\vec{v}_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i\vec{v}_i}{m_1 \space +\space m_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i}$

$M\vec{v}_{cm} = m_1\vec{v}_1 \space +\space m_2\vec{v}_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i\vec{v}_i = \vec{P}$

So the total momentum \vec{P} of a system equals the total mass times the velocity of the center of mass.

#### External forces and Center-of-Mass Motion

Let $\vec{a}_{cm} = \Large\frac{d\vec{v}_{cm}}{dt}$ be the acceleration of the center of the mass; then
$M\vec{a}_{cm} = m_1\vec{a}_1 \space +\space m_2\vec{a}_2\space +\space ... \space+\space m_i\vec{a}_i$

$\sum\vec{F} = \sum\vec{F}_{ext} + \sum\vec{F}_{int} = M\vec{a}_{cm}$

Al internal forces cancel in pairs, and $\sum\vec{F}_{int} = 0$.
$\sum\vec{F}_{ext} = M\vec{a}_{cm}$

When a body or a collection of particles is acted on by external forces, the center of mass moves as though all the mass were concentrated at that point and it were acted on by a net force equal to the sum of the external forces on the system.

$\sum\vec{F}_{ext} = \Large\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}$


## 9 Rotation Of Rigid Bodies
### 9.1 Angular Velocity and Acceleration
Instead, we notice that the line OP is fixed in the body and rotates with it. The angle $\theta$ that OP makes with the +x-axis is a single angular coordinate that completely describes the body’s rotational position.

The angular coordinate $\theta$ of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis can be positive or negative. If we choose positive angles to be measured counterclock-wise from the positive x-axis

$\theta = \Large\frac{s}{r}$ or $s = r\theta$

$1\space\text{rad} =$ $\Large\frac{360°}{2\pi}$ $= 57.3°$

#### Angular Velocity
$\omega_z = \Large\frac{d\theta}{dt}$
Is the ratio of change of the $\theta$ angle.
The subscript z indicates that the body is rotating about the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the plane of the diagram.

If angle $\theta$ is in radians, the unit of angular velocity is the radian per second (rad/s). Other units, such as the revolution per minute (rev/min or rpm).

$1\space\text{rev/s} = 2\pi\space\text{rad/s}$ and $1\space\text{rev/min} = 1 \space\text{rpm} = \frac{2\pi}{60}\text{rad/s}$
the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation.

#### Angular Acceleration
$\Large\alpha_z = \frac{d\omega_z}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$

The usual unit of angular acceleration is the radian per second per second, or $rad/s^2$

### 9.2 Rotation With Constant Angular Acceleration

$\omega_z = \omega_{0z} + \alpha_zt$
$\theta = \theta_0 + \omega_{0z} + \frac{1}{2}\alpha_zt^2$
$\theta - \theta_0 = \frac{1}{2}(\omega_{0z} + \omega_z)t$
$\omega_z^2 = \omega_{0z}^2 + 2\alpha_z(\theta - \theta_0)$


### 9.3 Relating Linear and Angular Kinematics

#### Linear Speed in Rigid-Body Rotation
$s = r\theta$ -> $|\frac{ds}{dt}| = r|\frac{d\theta}{dt}|$
$v = r\omega$

#### Linear Acceleration in Rigid-Body Rotation
$a_{tan} = \frac{dv}{dt} = r\frac{d\omega}{dt} = r\alpha$

**Centripetal Acceleration**
$a_{rad} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r$

### 9.4 Energy in Rotational Motion
A rotating rigid body consists of mass in motion, so it has kinetic energy. As we will see, we can express this kinetic energy in terms of the body’s angular speed and a new quantity

Different particles have different values of ri, but v is the same for all (otherwise, the body wouldn’t be rigid). The kinetic energy of the ith particle can be expressed as
$\frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_ir_i^2\omega^2$
$K = \frac{1}{2}m_2r_2^2\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2r_2^2\omega^2 + ... + \frac{1}{2}m_nr_n^2\omega^2 = \sum^n \frac{1}{2}m_ir_i^2\omega^2$
$K = \frac{1}{2}(m_2r_2^2 + m_2r_2^2 + ... + m_nr_n^2)\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\sum^n m_ir_i^2)\omega^2$

The quantity in parentheses, obtained by multiplying the mass of each particle by the square of its distance from the axis of rotation and adding these products, is called the moment of inertia I of the body for this rotation axis: $I = \sum^n m_ir_i^2$

“Moment” means that I depends on how the body’s mass is distributed in space; it has nothing to do with a “moment” of time. For a body with a given rotation axis and a given total mass, the greater the distances from the axis to the particles that make up the body, the greater the moment of inertia $I$. In a rigid body, all distances $r_i$ are constant and $I$ is independent of how the body rotates around the given axis. The SI unit of I is the kilogram-meter<sup>2</sup> $(kg \cdot m^2)$.

$K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$
Equation gives a simple physical interpretation of moment of inertia: *The greater the moment of inertia, the greater the kinetic energy of a rigid body rotating with a given angular speed v*.

![[MPS Some Moments of Inertia.png]]

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 9.1.png]]

#### Gravitational Potential Energy for an Extended Body
If the acceleration of gravity $g$ is the same at all points on the body, the gravitational potential energy is the same as though all the mass were concentrated at the center of mass of the body. Suppose we take the y-axis vertically upward. Then for a body with total mass $M$, the gravitational potential energy $U$ is simply
$U = Mgy_{cm}$

### 9.5 Parallel-Axis Theorem
A body doesn’t have just one moment of inertia. In fact, it has infinitely many, because there are infinitely many axes about which it might rotate. But there is a simple relationship, called the parallel-axis theorem, between the moment of inertia of a body about an axis through its center of mass and the moment of inertia about any other axis parallel to the original axis
$I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2$

### 9.6 Moment-Of-Inertia Calculations
If a rigid body is a continuous distribution of mass it cannot be represented by a few point masses. In this case the sum of masses and distances that defines the moment of inertia becomes an *integral*.
Then the moment of inertia is
$I = \int r^2\space dm$

To evaluate the integral, we have to represent r and dm in terms of the same integration variable. When the object is effectively one-dimensional, such as the slender rods 

For a three-dimensional object it is usually easiest to express $dm$ in terms of an element of volume $dV$ and the density r of the body. Density is mass per unit volume, $\rho = dm/dV$
$I = \int r^2\rho\space dV$

If the body is uniform in density, then we may take $\rho$ outside the integral:
$I = \rho\int r^2\space dV$

## 10 Dynamics Of Rotational Motion
### 10.1 Torque
We know that forces acting on a body can affect its translational motion- that is, the motion of the body as a whole through space. Now we want to learn which aspects of a force determine how effective it is in causing or changing rotational motion. The magnitude and direction of the force are important, but so is the point on the body where the force is applied. 

*The quantitative measure of the tendency of a force to cause or change a body’s rotational motion is called torque*

To cause a rotation about $O$ depends on its magnitude $F_1$. It also depends on the perpendicular distance l1 between point $O$ and the line of action of the force 
$\tau = Fl$

There are three ways to calculate the torque of *$\vec{F}$*:
1. Find the lever arm $l$ and use $\tau = Fl$.
2. Determine the angle $\phi$ between the vectors $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$; the lever arm is $r\sin\phi$, so $\tau = rF\sin\phi$.
3. Represent $\vec{F}$ in terms of a radial component $F_{rad}$ along the direction of $\vec{r}$ and a tangential component $F_{tan}$ at right angles, perpendicular to $\vec{r}$. (We call this component tangential because if the body rotates, the point where the force acts moves in a circle, and this component is tangent to that circle.) Then $F_{tan} = F \sin\phi$ and $\tau = r(F\sin\phi)\space=\space F_{tan}r$. The component $F_{rad}$ produces no torque with respect to O because its lever arm with  respect to that point is zero

#### Torque As a Vector
Angular velocity and angular acceleration can be represented as vectors; the same is true for torque. To see how to do this, note that the quantity $rF\sin\phi$ is the magnitude of the vector product $\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$.
$\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$

### 10.2 Torque and Angular Acceleration for a Rigid Body
The angular acceleration of a rotating rigid body is directly proportional to the sum of the torque components along the axis of rotation. The proportionality factor is the moment of inertia.
$\sum\tau_z = I\alpha_z$

Just as Newton’s second law says that a net force on a particle causes an acceleration in the direction of the net force, Eq. (10.7) says that a net torque on a rigid body about an axis causes an angular acceleration about that axis.
![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 10.1.png]]

### 10.3 Rigid-Body Rotation About a Moving Axis
We can extend our analysis of the dynamics of rotational motion to some cases in which the axis of rotation moves. When that happens, the motion of the body is combined translation and rotation. Every possible motion of a rigid body can be represented as a combination of translational motion of the center of mass and rotation about an 
axis through the center of mass. This is true even when the center of mass accelerates, so it is not at rest in any inertial frame.

#### Combined Translation and Rotation Energy Relationships
For such a body, K is the sum of two parts:
$K = \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2$

#### Rolling Without Slipping
An important case of combined translation and rotation is rolling without slipping. 
We view the motion in an inertial frame of reference in 
which the surface on which the wheel rolls is at rest. In this frame, the point on the wheel that contacts the surface must be instantaneously at rest so that it does not slip.

Hence the velocity $\vec{v}_1'$ of the point of contact relative to the center of mass must have the same magnitude but opposite direction as the center-of-mass velocity $\vec{v}_{cm}$. If the wheel’s radius is $R$ and its angular speed about the center of mass is $\omega$, then the magnitude of $\vec{v}_1'$ is $R\omega$; hence $v_{cm} = R\omega$.

#### Combined Translation and Rotation: Dynamics
We can also analyze the combined translational and rotational motions of a rigid body from the standpoint of dynamics. We showed in Section 8.5 that for an extended body, the acceleration of the center of mass is the same as that of a particle of the same mass acted on by all the external forces on the actual body.
The rotational motion about the center of mass is described by the rotational analog of Newton’s second law:
$\sum\tau_z=\i_{cm}\alpha_z$

It’s not immediately obvious that Eq. (10.13) should apply to the motion of a translating rigid body; after all, our derivation of gtz = Iaz in Section 10.2 assumed that the axis of rotation was stationary. But Eq. (10.13) is valid even when the axis of rotation moves, provided the following two conditions are met:
 1. The axis through the center of mass must be an axis of symmetry.
 2. The axis must not change direction.

### 10.4 Work and Power in Rotational Motion
When you pedal a bicycle, you apply forces to a rotating body and do work on it. Similar things happen in many other real-life situations, such as a rotating motor shaft driving a power tool or a car engine propelling the vehicle. 

$dW = F_{tan}Rd\theta$
$W = \int^{\theta_2}_{\theta_1}\tau_zd\theta$

If the torque is constant $W = \tau(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = \tau_z\Delta\theta$

When a torque does work on a rotating rigid body, the kinetic energy changes by an amount equal to the work done. We can prove this by using exactly the same procedure that we used in Eqs. (6.11) through (6.13) for the translational kinetic energy of a particle.

How does power relate to torque? When we divide both sides of Eq. (10.19) by the time interval dt during which the angular displacement occurs, we find
$P = \tau_z\omega_z$

### 10.5 Angular Momentum
Every rotational quantity that we have encountered in Chapters 9 and 10 is the analog of some quantity in the translational motion of a particle. The analog of momentum of a particle is angular momentum, a vector quantity denoted as $\vec{L}$. Its relationship to momentum $\vec{p}$ (which we will often call linear momentum for clarity) is exactly the same as the relationship of torque to force, $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$. For  particle with constant mass m and velocity v, the angular momentum is
$\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p}=\vec{r}\times m\vec{v}$

he right-hand rule for vector products shows that its direction is 
along the +z@axis, and its magnitude is
$L = mvr\sin\phi = mvl$

The rate of change of angular momentum of a particle equals the torque of 
the net force acting on it. 
$\sum\vec{\tau}=\Large\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}$

#### Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body
The angular velocity vector V also lies along the rotation axis, as we saw in Section 9.1. Hence for a rigid body rotating around an axis of symmetry, L and V are in the same direction (Fig. 10.26). So we have the vector relationship
$\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}$

### 10.6 Conservation of angular Momentum
We have just seen that angular momentum can be used for an alternative statement of the basic dynamic principle for rotational motion. It also forms the basis for the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Like conservation of energy and of linear momentum, this principle is a universal conservation law, valid at all scales from atomic and nuclear systems to the motions of galaxies
When the net external torque acting on a system is zero, the total angular momentum of the system is constant (conserved).
if $\sum\vec{\tau}=\Large\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = 0$ so $\vec{L}$ is constant.

## 11 Equilibrium and Elasticity
### 11.1 Conditions of Equilibrium
For an extended body, the equivalent statement is that the center of mass of the body has zero acceleration if the vector sum of all external forces acting on the body is zero, as discussed in Section 8.5. This is often called the first condition for equilibrium:
$\sum\vec{F} = 0$

A rigid body in equilibrium can’t have any tendency to start 
rotating about any point, so the sum of external torques must be zero about any 
point. This is the second condition for equilibrium:
$\sum\vec{\tau} = 0$

### 11.2 Center of Gravity
In most equilibrium problems, one of the forces acting on the body is its weight. We need to be able to calculate the torque of this force. The weight doesn’t act at a single point; it is distributed over the entire body. But we can always calculate the torque due to the body’s weight by assuming that the entire force of gravity (weight) is concentrated at a point called the center of gravity (abbreviated “cg”).

First let’s review the definition of the center of mass.
Now consider the gravitational torque on a body of arbitrary shape.
Every particle in the body experiences a gravitational force, and the total weight of the body is the vector sum of a large number of parallel forces. A typical particle has mass $m_i$ and weight $\vec{w}_i = m_i\vec{g}$. If $\vec{r}_i$ is the position vector of this particle with respect to an arbitrary origin O, then the torque vector
$\vec{\tau} = \vec{r}_{cm}\times M\vec{g}$

#### finding and using the Center of gravity
We can often use symmetry considerations to locate the center of gravity of a body, just as we did for the center of mass. The center of gravity of a homogeneous sphere, cube, or rectangular plate is at its geometric center. The center of gravity of a right circular cylinder or cone is on its axis of symmetry.

When a body in rotational equilibrium and acted on by gravity is supported or suspended at a single point, the center of gravity is always at or directly above or below the point of suspension. If it were anywhere else, the weight would have a torque with respect to the point of suspension, and the body could not be in rotational equilibrium. 
The lower the center of gravity and the larger the area of support, the harder it is to overturn a body.

### 11.3 Solving Equilibrium Problems

There are just two key conditions for rigid-body equilibrium: The vector sum of the forces on the body must be zero, and the sum of the torques about any point must be zero. To keep things simple, we’ll restrict our attention to situations in which we can treat all forces as acting in a single plane, which we’ll call the xy-plane. Then we need consider only the x- and y-components of force in Eq. (11.1), and in Eq. (11.2) we need consider only the z-components of torque

## 14 Periodic Motion
### 14.1 Describing Oscillation
Many kinds of motion repeat themselves over and over: the vibration of  a quartz crystal in a watch, the swinging pendulum of a grandfather clock, the sound vibrations produced by a clarinet or an organ pipe, and the back-and-forth motion of the pistons in a car engine. This kind of motion, called periodic motion or oscillation.

It’s simplest to define our coordinate system so that the origin O is at the equilibrium position, where the spring is neither stretched nor compressed. Then x is the x-component of the displacement of the body from equilibrium and is also the change in the length of the spring. The spring exerts a force on the body with x-component $F_x$.

When the body is at O, the net force acting on it is zero (Fig. 14.2b), but because of its motion it overshoots the equilibrium position. On the other side of the equilibrium position the body is still moving to the left, but the net force and the acceleration are to the right (Fig. 14.2c); hence the speed decreases until the body comes to a stop. We will show later that with an ideal spring, the stopping point is at x = -A. The body then accelerates to the right, overshoots equilibrium again, and stops at the starting point x = A, ready to repeat the whole process. The body is oscillating! If there is no friction or other force to remove mechanical energy from the system, this motion repeats forever; the restoring force perpetually draws the body back toward the equilibrium position, only to have the body overshoot time after time.

#### Amplitude, Period Frequency, and Angular Frequency
The amplitude of the motion, denoted by A, is the maximum magnitude of displacement from equilibrium—that is, the maximum value of 0 x0 . It is always positive. If the spring in Fig. 14.2 is an ideal one, the total overall range of the motion is 2A. The SI unit of A is the meter. A complete vibration, or cycle, is one complete round trip—say, from A to -A and back to A.

The period, $T$, is the time to complete one cycle. It is always positive. The SI unit is the second, but it is sometimes expressed as “seconds per cycle.”
The frequency, $f$, is the number of cycles in a unit of time. It is always positive. The SI unit of frequency is the hertz, named for the 19th-century German physicist Heinrich Hertz:

$1\space hertz = 1\space Hz = 1\space cycle/s = 1\space s^{-1}$

The angular frequency, $\omega$, is $2\pi$ times the frequency:
$\omega=2\pi f$
$\omega$ is a useful quantity. It represents the rate of change of an angular quantity (not necessarily related to a rotational motion) that is always measured in radians, so its units are $rad/s$.

By definition, period and frequency are reciproclas of each other:
$f=\large\frac{1}{T}$ $T=\large\frac{1}{f}$
Also, from the definition of $\omega$.
$\omega=2\pi f=\large\frac{2\pi}{T}$

### 14.2 Simple Harmonic Motion
The simplest kind of oscillation occurs when the restoring force Fx is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium x. This happens if the spring in Figs. 14.1 and 14.2 is an ideal one that obeys Hooke’s law (see Section 6.3). The constant of proportionality between $F_x$ and x is the force constant k. On either side of the equilibrium position, $F_x$ and x always have opposite signs.

$F_x = -kx$

When the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, as given by Eq. (14.3), the oscillation is called simple harmonic motion (SHM). The acceleration

$a_x = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{m}x$
The minus sign means that, in SHM, the acceleration and displacement always have opposite signs. This acceleration is not constant.

#### Circular Motion and the Equations of SHM 
![[MPS Circular Motion as SHM.png]]
That is, simple harmonic motion is the projection of uniform circular motion onto a diameter.

The x-component of the phasor at time t is just the x-coordinate of the point Q:
$x = A \cos\theta$

we get that the acceleration of point P is:
$a_x = -w^2x$

provided that the angular speed v of the reference point Q is related to the force constant k and mass m of the oscillating body by
$w^2=\frac{k}{m}$

Frequency
$f=\large\frac{w}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$

So, Period
$T = 2\pi\large\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$


#### Period and Amplitude is SHM
Equations (14.11) and (14.12) show that the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion are completely determined by the mass m and the force constant k. In simple harmonic motion the period and frequency do not depend on the amplitude A. For given values of m and k, the time of one complete oscillation is the same whether the amplitude is large or small. 

#### Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration in SHM
$x = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$
$v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = -\omega A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$
$a_x = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\omega^2A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$
$\phi = \arctan\large(-\frac{v_{0x}}{\omega x_0})$
$A = \sqrt{x^2_0 + \Large\frac{v_{0x}^2}{\omega^2}}$

### 14.3 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion
The total mechanical energy E is also directly related to the amplitude A of the motion. When the body reaches the point $x = A$, its maximum displacement from equilibrium, it momentarily stops as it turns back toward the equilibrium position. That is, when $x = A$ (or $-A$), $v_x = 0$.$ At this point the energy is entirely potential, and $E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Because E is constant, it is equal to $\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ at any other  point.

$E = \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$
$E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2\sin^2(\omega t + \phi) + \frac{1}{2}kA^2\cos^2(\omega t + \phi) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$
