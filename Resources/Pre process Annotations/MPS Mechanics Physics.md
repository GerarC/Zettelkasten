## Chapter 1: Units, Physical Quantities, and Vectors
### 1.1 Nature of physics
No theory is ever regarded as the final or ultimate truth. The possibility al- ways exists that new observations will require that a theory be revised or discarded. It is in the nature of physical theory that we can disprove a theory by  finding behavior that is inconsistent with it, but we can never prove that a theory is always correct. *Page 27*

### 1.2 Solving physics problems

You may find it useful to remember the acronym **I SEE**—short for *Identify*, *Set up*, *Execute*, and *Evaluate* *Page 28*

### 1.3 Standards and Units
To make accurate, reliable measurements, we need units of measurement  that do not change and that can be duplicated by observers in various locations.  The system of units used by scientists and engineers around the world is commonly called “the metric system,” but since 1960 it has been known officially as  the **International System**, or **SI** (the abbreviation for its French name, *Système  International*). Appendix A gives a list of all SI units as well as definitions of the most fundamental units. *Page 29*

#### Time 
It is based on an atomic clock, which uses the energy difference between  the two lowest energy states of the cesium atom (133Cs). When bombarded by  microwaves of precisely the proper frequency, cesium atoms undergo a transition from one of these states to the other. One **second** (abbreviated s) is defined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 cycles of this microwave radiation. *Page 29*

#### Length
Hence the new definition if the **meter** (abbreviated m) is the distance that light travels in vacuum in 1>299,792,458 second. This modern definition provides a much more precise standard of length than the one based on a wave-length of light. *Page 30*

#### Mass
The standard of mass, the **kilogram** (abbreviated kg), is defined to be the mass of  a particular cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept at the International Bureau  of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, near Paris. An atomic standard  of mass would be more fundamental, but at present we cannot measure masses  on an atomic scale with as much accuracy as on a macroscopic scale. The *gram* (which is not a fundamental unit) is 0.001 kilogram. *Page 30*


### 1.4 Using and Converting Units
An equation must always be dimensionally consistent. You can’t add apples  and automobiles; two terms may be added or equated only if they have the same  units. For example, if a body moving with constant speed v travels a distance d in a time t, these quantities are related by the equation *Page 31*

Always use units in calculations Make it a habit to always write  numbers with the correct units and carry the units through the calculation as in the  example above. This provides a very useful check. If at some stage in a calculation  you find that an equation or an expression  has inconsistent units, you know you have  made an error. *Page 31*

### 1.5 Uncertainty and Significant Figures
The distinction between the measurements with a ruler and with a caliper is in their **uncertainty**; the measurement with a caliper has a smaller uncertainty. The uncertainty is also called the **error** because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value. The uncertainty or error of a measured value depends on the measurement technique used. *Page 33*

In many cases the uncertainty of a number is not stated explicitly. Instead, the uncertainty is indicated by the number of meaningful digits, or **significant  figures**, in the measured value. We gave the thickness of the cover of the book as 2.91 mm, which has three significant figures. By this we mean that the first two digits are known to  be correct, while the third digit is uncertain. *Page 33*

When you use numbers that have uncertainties to compute other numbers, the  computed numbers are also uncertain. When numbers are multiplied or divided,  the result can have no more significant figures than the factor with the fewest significant figures has. For example, 3.1416 * 2.34 * 0.58 = 4.3. When we add and subtract numbers, it’s the location of the decimal point that matters, not the number of significant figures. For example, 123.62 + 8.9 = 132.5. *Page 33*

### 1.6 Estimates and Orders of Magnitude
I don't care.

### 1.7 Vectors
Some physical quantities, such as time, temperature, mass, and density, can be described completely by a single number with a unit. But many other important quantities in physics have a direction associated with them and cannot be described by a single number.

When a physical quantity is described by a single number, we call it a scalar quantity. In contrast, a vector quantity has both a magnitude (the “how much” or “how big” part) and a direction in space.

We usually represent a vector quantity such as displacement by a single letter, such as $\vec{A}$

We usually represent the magnitude of a vector quantity by the same letter used for the vector, but in lightface italic type with no arrow on top.

### 1.8 Components of Vectors
 
$\frac{Ax}{A} = \cos\theta$ and $\frac{Ay}{A} = \sin\theta$
 
$Ax = A \cos\theta$ and $Ay = A \sin\theta$

 ![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 1.3.png]]

### 1.9 Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1, with no units. Its only purpose is to point—that is, to describe a direction in space. Unit vectors provide a convenient notation for many expressions involving components of vectors. We will always include a caret, or “hat” (^), in the symbol for a unit vector to distinguish it from ordinary vectors whose magnitude may or may not be equal to 1.

In an xy-coordinate system we can define a unit vector $\hat{i}$ that points in the direction of the positive x-axis and a unit vector $\hat{j}$ that points in the direction of the positive y-axis.

$\vec{A} = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j}$

### 1.10 Product of Vectors
**Scalar Product**
We denote the scalar product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ by $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$. Because of this notation, the scalar product is also called the dot product. Although $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are vectors, the quantity $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$ is a scalar.  

$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = AB\cos\phi = \vec{A}\vec{B}\cos\phi$
or
$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = A_xB_x + A_y+B_y + A_zB_z$


**Vector Product**
We denote the vector product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, also called the cross product, by $\vec{A}\times\vec{B}$. As the name suggests, the vector product is itself a vector.

$C = AB\sin\phi$
or
$C_x = A_yB_z - A_zB_y \qquad C_y = A_zB_x - A_xB_z \qquad C_z = A_xB_y - A_yB_x$

## Chapter 2: Motion Along the Straight Line
### 2.1 Displacement, Time and Average Velocity
 
$\Delta x = x-2 - x-1$

**Average Velocity**
$v_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_2}$

### 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity

$v_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$

### 2.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration
Just as velocity describes the rate of change of position with time, acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity with time. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector quantity. 

$a_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

**Instantaneous Acceleration**
$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}$

### 2.4 Motion With constant Acceleration
The simplest kind of accelerated motion is straight-line motion with constant acceleration. In this case the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the motion. As an example, a falling body has a constant acceleration if the effects of the air are not important.

$a_x = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

$v_x = v_{0x} + a_xt$

$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$

$t = \frac{v_x - v_{0x}}{a_x}$

$v_x^2 = v_{0x}^2 + 2a_x(\Delta x)$

$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_{0x} + v_x)t$

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 2.1.png]]

### 2.5 Free Falling Bodies
The most familiar example of motion with (nearly) constant acceleration is a body falling under the influence of the earth’s gravitational attraction. Such motion has held the attention of philosophers and scientists since ancient times. In the fourth century b.c., Aristotle thought (erroneously) that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies, in proportion to their weight. Nineteen centuries later, Galileo (see Section 1.1) argued that a body should fall with a downward acceleration that is constant and independent of its weight.

The constant acceleration of a freely falling body is called the acceleration due to gravity, and we denote its magnitude with the letter g. We will frequently use the approximate value of g at or near the earth’s surface:
$g = 9.80m/s^2$

## 3 Motions in Two or Three Dimensions
### 3.1 Position and Velocity Vectors
Let’s see how to describe a particle’s motion in space. If the particle is at a point P  at a certain instant, the position vector $\vec{r}$ of the particle at this instant is a vector that goes from the origin of the coordinate system to point P (Fig. 3.1 on next page). The Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z of point P are the x-, y-, and z-components of Vector $\vec{r}$

$\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$

$\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$

### 3.2 The Acceleration Vector

$\vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$

### 3.3 Projectile Motion
A projectile is any body that is given an initial velocity and then follows a path determined entirely by the effects of gravitational acceleration and air resistance. A batted baseball, a thrown football, and a bullet shot from a rifle are all projectiles. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory

**Horizontal movement**
$a_x = 0$
$v_x = v_{0x}$
$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t$

**Vertical movement**
$a_y = -g$
$v_y = v_{0y} - gt$
$y = y_0 + v_{0y}t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

**Velocity Components**
$v_{0x} = v_0\cos\alpha_0  \qquad v_{0y} = v_0\sin\alpha_0$

now
$x = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)t$
$v_{x} = v_0\cos\alpha_0$

$y = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
$v_{y} = v_0\sin\alpha_0 - gt$

$\tan\alpha = \frac{v_y}{v_x}$

![[MPS Problem Solving Strategy 3.1.png]]

### 3.4 Motion in a Circle
When a particle moves along a curved path, the direction of its velocity changes. As we saw in Section 3.2, this means that the particle must have a component of acceleration perpendicular to the path, even if its speed is constant (see Fig. 3.11b).

**Uniform Circular Motion**
When a particle moves in a circle with constant speed, the motion is called uniform circular motion.

$a_{rad} = a_n = \frac{v^2}{R}$

$v = \frac{2\pi R}{T}$
$a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

the total acceleration is:
$a = \sqrt{a_{rad}^2 + a_{tan}^2}$

**Nonuniform Circular Motion**
In nonuniform circular motion there is also a component of acceleration that is parallel to the instantaneous velocity. Here we call this component $a_{tan}$  

### 3.5 Relative Velocity
Relative velocity: When a body P moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $B$, and $B$ moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $A$, we denote the velocity of $P$ relative to $B$ by $\vec{v}_{P/B}$, the velocity of $P$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{P/A}$, and the velocity of $B$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{B/A}$. If these velocities are all along the same line, their components along that line are related by Eq. (3.32). More generally, these velocities are related by Eq.

$v_{P/A-x} = v_{P/B-x} + v_{B/A-x}$
(relative velocity along a line)

$\vec{v}_{P/A} = \vec{v}_{P/B} + \vec{v}_{B/A}$
(relative velocity in space)

## 4 Newton's Laws of Motion
### 4.1 Force and Interaction
a force is a push or a pull. A better definition is that a force is an interaction between two bodies or between a body and its environment. That’s why we always refer to the force that one body exerts on a second body.

To describe a force vector $\vec{F}$, we need to describe the direction in which it acts as well as its magnitude, the quantity that describes “how much” or “how hard” the force pushes or pulls. The SI unit of the magnitude of force is the newton, abbreviated N.

**Superposition of Forces**
When you throw a ball, at least two forces act on it: the push of your hand and the downward pull of gravity. Experiment shows that when two forces $\vec{F}_1$ and $\vec{F}_2$ act at the same time at the same point on a body, the effect on the body’s motion is the same as if a single force $\vec{R}$ were acting equal to the vector sum, or resultant, of the original forces: $\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2$. More generally, any number of forces applied at a point on a body have the same effect as a single force equal to the vector sum of the forces. This important principle is called superposition of forces.

### Newton's First Law
**Newton's First Law of Motion:** A body acted on by no net force has a constant velocity (which may be zero) and zero acceleration.

The tendency of a body to keep moving once it is set in motion is called **inertia**.

It’s important to note that the net force is what matters in Newton’s first law. For example, a physics book at rest on a horizontal tabletop has two forces acting on it: an upward supporting force, or normal force, exerted by the tabletop (see Fig. 4.2a) and the downward force of the earth’s gravity (which acts even if the tabletop is elevated above the ground;

When a body is either at rest or moving with constant velocity (in a straight line with constant speed), we say that the body is in equilibrium. For a body to be in equilibrium, it must be acted on by no forces, or by several forces such that their vector sum—that is, the net force—is zero:
$\sum\vec{F}=0$

The point is that the bus is accelerating with respect to the earth and is not a suitable frame of reference for Newton’s first law. This law is valid in some frames of reference and not valid in others. A frame of reference in which Newton’s first law is valid is called an inertial frame of reference. The earth is at least approximately an inertial frame of reference, but the bus is not. (The earth is not a completely inertial frame, owing to the acceleration associated with its rotation and its motion around the sun. These effects are quite small, however) Because Newton’s first law is used to define what we mean by an inertial frame of reference, it is sometimes called the law of inertia.

### 4.3 Newton's Second Law

**Mass and Force**
Our results mean that for a given body, the ratio of the magnitude $|\sum\vec{F}|$ of the net force to the magnitude $a=|\vec{a}|$ of the acceleration is constant, regardless of the magnitude of net force. We call this ratio the **inertial mass**, or simply the **mass**, of the body and denote it by *m*. That is,
$$m = \sum\frac{|\vec{F}|}{a} \quad or \quad |\vec{F}|=ma \quad or \quad a = \frac{|\vec{F}|}{m}$$
The SI unit of mass is the kilogram. We mentioned in Section 1.3 that the kilogram is officially defined to be the mass of a cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept in a vault near Paris (Fig. 1.4). We can use this standard kilogram, along with Eqs. (4.4), to define the newton: One newton is the amount of net force that gives an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared to a body with a mass of 1 kilogram.
$$1N = 1kg\cdot m/s^2$$

**Stating Newton’s Second Law**
Newton's Second Law of Motion: If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. The mass of the body times the acceleration vector of the body equals the net force vector.

In symbols,
$\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$

>[!Note]
The force is also defined as the change of momentum in a time.
$\large\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$
>**From:**[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)

**Using Newton’s Second Law**
Usually we will use it in component form, with a separate equation for each component of force and the corresponding component of acceleration:
$\sum F_x = ma_x \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x$

Second, the statement of Newton’s second law refers to external forces. It’s impossible for a body to affect its own motion by exerting a force on itself;

like the first law. Thus it is not valid in the reference frame of any of the accelerating vehicles in Fig. 4.10

### 4.4 Mass and Weight
Mass characterizes the inertial properties of a body. Mass is what keeps the china on the table when you yank the tablecloth out from under it. The greater the mass, the greater the force needed to cause a given acceleration; this is reflected in Newton’s second law, $\sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$.
Weight, on the other hand, is a force exerted on a body by the pull of the earth. Mass and weight are related: Bodies that have large mass also have large weight. A large stone is hard to throw because of its large mass, and hard to lift off the ground because of its large weight.
$\vec{w}=m\vec{g}$

### 4.5 Newton's Third Law
Newton's Third Law of Motion: If body A exerts a force on body B (an “action”), then body B exerts a force on body A (a “reaction”). These two forces have the same magnitude but are opposite in direction. These two forces act on different bodies.
$\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$
It doesn’t matter whether one body is inanimate

### 4.6 Free-Body Diagrams
Newton’s three laws of motion contain all the basic principles we need to solve a wide variety of problems in mechanics. These laws are very simple in form, but the process of applying them to specific situations can pose real challenges. In this brief section we’ll point out three key ideas and techniques to use in any problems involving Newton’s laws. You’ll learn others in Chapter 5, which also extends the use of Newton’s laws to cover more complex situations.
 1. Newton’s first and second laws apply to a specific body. Whenever you use Newton’s first law, $\sum\vec{F}=0$, for an equilibrium situation or Newton’s second law, $\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$, for a non-equilibrium situation, you must decide at the beginning to which body you are referring. This decision may sound trivial, but it isn’t.
 2. Only forces acting on the body matter. The sum $\sum\vec{F}$ includes all the forces that act on the body in question. Hence, once you’ve chosen the body to analyze, you have to identify all the forces acting on it. Don’t confuse the forces acting on a body with the forces exerted by that body on some other body. For example, to analyze a person walking, you would include in $\sum\vec{F}$ the force that the ground exerts on the person as he walks, but not the force that the person exerts on the ground (Fig. 4.28). These forces form an action–reaction pair and are related by Newton’s third law, but only the member of the pair that acts on the body you’re working with goes into $\sum\vec{F}$.
 3. Free-body diagrams are essential to help identify the relevant forces. A free-body diagram shows the chosen body by itself, “free” of its surroundings, with vectors drawn to show the magnitudes and directions of all the forces that act on the body. We’ve already shown free-body diagrams in Figs. 4.17, 4.18, 4.20, and 4.25a. Be careful to include all the forces acting on the body, but be equally careful not to include any forces that the body exerts on any other body. In particular, the two forces in an action–reaction pair must never appear in the same free-body diagram because they never act on the same body. Furthermore, never include forces that a body exerts on itself, since these can’t affect the body’s motion.

When a problem involves more than one body, you have to take the problem apart and draw a separate free-body diagram for each body.

### 5.3 Friction Forces
Friction is important in many aspects of everyday life. The oil in a car engine minimizes friction between moving parts, but without friction between the tires and the road we couldn’t drive or turn the car.

**Kinetic and static Friction**
First, when a body rests or slides on a surface, we can think of the surface as exerting a single contact force on the body, with force components perpendicular and parallel to the surface (Fig. 5.17). The perpendicular component vector is the normal force, denoted by $\vec{n}$. The component vector parallel to the surface (and perpendicular to $\vec{n}$) is the friction force, denoted by $\vec{f}$. If the surface is frictionless, then $\vec{f}$ is zero but there is still a normal force.

The kind of friction that acts when a body slides over a surface is called a **kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$**. The adjective “kinetic” and the subscript “$k$” remind us that the two surfaces are moving relative to each other. The magnitude of the kinetic friction force usually increases when the normal force increases. This is why it takes more force to slide a full box of books across the floor than an empty one.
In many cases the magnitude of the kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$ is found experimentally to be approximately proportional to the magnitude n of the normal force:
$$f_k = \mu_kn$$

>[!warning] CAUTION
>Friction and normal forces are always perpendicular Remember that Eq. (5.3) is not a vector equation because $\vec{f}_k$ and $\vec{n}$ are always perpendicular. Rather, it is a scalar relationship between the magnitudes of the two forces.

Friction forces may also act when there is no relative motion. If you try to slide a box across the floor, the box may not move at all because the floor exerts an equal and opposite friction force on the box. This is called a **static friction force $\vec{f}_s$**.    
![[MPU Frictions.png]]

$f_s \le (f_S)_{max} = \mu_sn$

### 5.4 Dynamics of Circular Motion
We can also express the centripetal acceleration $a_{rad}$ in terms of the period $T$, the time for one revolution:
 
$\large T = \frac{2\pi R}{v}$ -> replacing in $a_{rad}=\frac{v^2}{R}$

$a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

The magnitude of the radial acceleration is given by arad = v2>R, so the magnitude Fnet of the net force on a particle with mass m in uniform circular motion must be
$F_{net} = ma_{rad} = m \frac{v^2}{R}$

Uniform circular motion can result from any combination of forces, just so the net force $\sum\vec{F}$ is always directed toward the center of the circle and has a constant magnitude. Note that the body need not move around a complete circle: is valid for any path that can be regarded as part of a circular arc.
