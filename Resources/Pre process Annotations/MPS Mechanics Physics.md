## Chapter 1: Units, Physical Quantities, and Vectors
### 1.1 Nature of physics
No theory is ever regarded as the final or ultimate truth. The possibility al- ways exists that new observations will require that a theory be revised or discarded. It is in the nature of physical theory that we can disprove a theory by  finding behavior that is inconsistent with it, but we can never prove that a theory is always correct. *Page 27*

### 1.2 Solving physics problems

You may find it useful to remember the acronym **I SEE**—short for *Identify*, *Set up*, *Execute*, and *Evaluate* *Page 28*

### 1.3 Standards and Units
To make accurate, reliable measurements, we need units of measurement  that do not change and that can be duplicated by observers in various locations.  The system of units used by scientists and engineers around the world is commonly called “the metric system,” but since 1960 it has been known officially as  the **International System**, or **SI** (the abbreviation for its French name, *Système  International*). Appendix A gives a list of all SI units as well as definitions of the most fundamental units. *Page 29*

#### Time 
It is based on an atomic clock, which uses the energy difference between  the two lowest energy states of the cesium atom (133Cs). When bombarded by  microwaves of precisely the proper frequency, cesium atoms undergo a transition from one of these states to the other. One **second** (abbreviated s) is defined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 cycles of this microwave radiation. *Page 29*

#### Length
Hence the new definition if the **meter** (abbreviated m) is the distance that light travels in vacuum in 1>299,792,458 second. This modern definition provides a much more precise standard of length than the one based on a wave-length of light. *Page 30*

#### Mass
The standard of mass, the **kilogram** (abbreviated kg), is defined to be the mass of  a particular cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept at the International Bureau  of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, near Paris. An atomic standard  of mass would be more fundamental, but at present we cannot measure masses  on an atomic scale with as much accuracy as on a macroscopic scale. The *gram* (which is not a fundamental unit) is 0.001 kilogram. *Page 30*


### 1.4 Using and Converting Units
An equation must always be dimensionally consistent. You can’t add apples  and automobiles; two terms may be added or equated only if they have the same  units. For example, if a body moving with constant speed v travels a distance d in a time t, these quantities are related by the equation *Page 31*

Always use units in calculations Make it a habit to always write  numbers with the correct units and carry the units through the calculation as in the  example above. This provides a very useful check. If at some stage in a calculation  you find that an equation or an expression  has inconsistent units, you know you have  made an error. *Page 31*

### 1.5 Uncertainty and Significant Figures
The distinction between the measurements with a ruler and with a caliper is in their **uncertainty**; the measurement with a caliper has a smaller uncertainty. The uncertainty is also called the **error** because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value. The uncertainty or error of a measured value depends on the measurement technique used. *Page 33*

In many cases the uncertainty of a number is not stated explicitly. Instead, the uncertainty is indicated by the number of meaningful digits, or **significant  figures**, in the measured value. We gave the thickness of the cover of the book as 2.91 mm, which has three significant figures. By this we mean that the first two digits are known to  be correct, while the third digit is uncertain. *Page 33*

When you use numbers that have uncertainties to compute other numbers, the  computed numbers are also uncertain. When numbers are multiplied or divided,  the result can have no more significant figures than the factor with the fewest significant figures has. For example, 3.1416 * 2.34 * 0.58 = 4.3. When we add and subtract numbers, it’s the location of the decimal point that matters, not the number of significant figures. For example, 123.62 + 8.9 = 132.5. *Page 33*

### 1.6 Estimates and Orders of Magnitude
I don't care.

### 1.7 Vectors
Some physical quantities, such as time, temperature, mass, and density, can be described completely by a single number with a unit. But many other important quantities in physics have a direction associated with them and cannot be described by a single number.

When a physical quantity is described by a single number, we call it a scalar quantity. In contrast, a vector quantity has both a magnitude (the “how much” or “how big” part) and a direction in space.

We usually represent a vector quantity such as displacement by a single letter, such as $\vec{A}$

We usually represent the magnitude of a vector quantity by the same letter used for the vector, but in lightface italic type with no arrow on top.

### 1.8 Components of Vectors
 
$\frac{Ax}{A} = \cos\theta$ and $\frac{Ay}{A} = \sin\theta$
 
$Ax = A \cos\theta$ and $Ay = A \sin\theta$

### 1.9 Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1, with no units. Its only purpose is to point—that is, to describe a direction in space. Unit vectors provide a convenient notation for many expressions involving components of vectors. We will always include a caret, or “hat” (^), in the symbol for a unit vector to distinguish it from ordinary vectors whose magnitude may or may not be equal to 1.

In an xy-coordinate system we can define a unit vector $\hat{i}$ that points in the direction of the positive x-axis and a unit vector $\hat{j}$ that points in the direction of the positive y-axis.

$\vec{A} = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j}$

### 1.10 Product of Vectors
**Scalar Product**
We denote the scalar product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ by $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$. Because of this notation, the scalar product is also called the dot product. Although $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are vectors, the quantity $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$ is a scalar.  

$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = AB\cos\phi = \vec{A}\vec{B}\cos\phi$
or
$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = A_xB_x + A_y+B_y + A_zB_z$


**Vector Product**
We denote the vector product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, also called the cross product, by $\vec{A}\times\vec{B}$. As the name suggests, the vector product is itself a vector.

$C = AB\sin\phi$
or
$C_x = A_yB_z - A_zB_y \qquad C_y = A_zB_x - A_xB_z \qquad C_z = A_xB_y - A_yB_x$

## Chapter 2: Motion Along the Straight Line
### 2.1 Displacement, Time and Average Velocity
 
$\Delta x = x-2 - x-1$

**Average Velocity**
$v_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_2}$

### 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity

$v_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$

### 2.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration
Just as velocity describes the rate of change of position with time, acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity with time. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector quantity. 

$a_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

**Instantaneous Acceleration**
$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}$

### 2.4 Motion With constant Acceleration
The simplest kind of accelerated motion is straight-line motion with constant acceleration. In this case the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the motion. As an example, a falling body has a constant acceleration if the effects of the air are not important.

$a_x = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

$v_x = v_{0x} + a_xt$

$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$

$t = \frac{v_x - v_{0x}}{a_x}$

$v_x^2 = v_{0x}^2 + 2a_x(\Delta x)$

$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_{0x} + v_x)t$

### 2.5 Free Falling Bodies
The most familiar example of motion with (nearly) constant acceleration is a body falling under the influence of the earth’s gravitational attraction. Such motion has held the attention of philosophers and scientists since ancient times. In the fourth century b.c., Aristotle thought (erroneously) that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies, in proportion to their weight. Nineteen centuries later, Galileo (see Section 1.1) argued that a body should fall with a downward acceleration that is constant and independent of its weight.

The constant acceleration of a freely falling body is called the acceleration due to gravity, and we denote its magnitude with the letter g. We will frequently use the approximate value of g at or near the earth’s surface:
$g = 9.80m/s^2$

## 3 Motions in Two or Three Dimensions
### 3.1 Position and Velocity Vectors
Let’s see how to describe a particle’s motion in space. If the particle is at a point P  at a certain instant, the position vector $\vec{r}$ of the particle at this instant is a vector that goes from the origin of the coordinate system to point P (Fig. 3.1 on next page). The Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z of point P are the x-, y-, and z-components of Vector $\vec{r}$

$\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$

$\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$

### 3.2 The Acceleration Vector

$\vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$

### 3.3 Projectile Motion
A projectile is any body that is given an initial velocity and then follows a path determined entirely by the effects of gravitational acceleration and air resistance. A batted baseball, a thrown football, and a bullet shot from a rifle are all projectiles. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory

**Horizontal movement**
$a_x = 0$
$v_x = v_{0x}$
$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t$

**Vertical movement**
$a_y = -g$
$v_y = v_{0y} - gt$
$y = y_0 + v_{0y}t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

**Velocity Components**
$v_{0x} = v_0\cos\alpha_0  \qquad v_{0y} = v_0\sin\alpha_0$

now
$x = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)t$
$v_{x} = v_0\cos\alpha_0$

$y = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
$v_{y} = v_0\sin\alpha_0 - gt$

$\tan\alpha = \frac{v_y}{v_x}$
