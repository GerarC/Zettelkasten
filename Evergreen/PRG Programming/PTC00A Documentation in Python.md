# PTC00A Documentation in Python

Python has a good [[ICC00C Importance of Documentation#ICC00C Importance of Documentation|documentation]] way with the docstrings and the annotations. With them we have good tools to document the code.
The annotations are very important because python is dynamically typed, and errors with the type of the parameters could occur.
Documentation was used to explain the type of the parameters of the functions o classes and its methods when the annotations didn't exist. Now you can use docstrings to explain how works your code, what raises an error, what is the return, and if the parameter is a complex type like a dictionary or something like that you can clarify how is composed it.
