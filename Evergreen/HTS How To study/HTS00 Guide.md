# HTS00 Guide

This vault follows Zettelkasten method to study. The point of this method is to not repeat the same idea in various [[HTS00A Note types|notes]], To do this, I use three [[HTS00A Note types|types of notes]] with a singular [[HTS00B Note Codes|coding way]] to name the files. 

I try to improve the codes linking way with the wikilinks and tags available in obsidian, so explore, read and search in this vault should be so quick and easy.
