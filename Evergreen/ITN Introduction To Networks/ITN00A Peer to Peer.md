# ITN00A Peer to Peer

Although *Client* and *Server* software usually run in different [[ITN00 Host#ITN00 Host|PCs]], It's possible use the same computer for both roles at the same time. **Peer to Peer** network is one which all end devices are used as both roles.

This type of network is easy to set up, hast low complexity, is cheaper than other types of networks and can be used for simple tasks. But has negative things too, such as it has no centralized administration, it's not as secure and its performance can be  slow because all devices act as *client* and *server*.
