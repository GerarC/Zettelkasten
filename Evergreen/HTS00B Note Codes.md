# HTS00B Note Codes

To differentiate topics of the notes I use a personal way of coding. The main idea is separate big topics with a code of 3 letters. For example HTS or PRG. This letters aren't chosen randomly, they are relate with the topic, for example PRG for programming and etc. The next part of the code is a number of two digits and it means a topic related with a big theme, for example 00 or 23. If you need to follow a sequence but is not the same idea of the last note you can create other with the same number but with a letter in the final. And if is the same Idea but more specific you can add a number into the same note.

If it's a [[HTS00A Note types#HTS00A/1 Source Notes|source note]] just need to add a `s` between the big topic code and the note code.

**Examples:** 
- HTS <- Big topic. In this case How To Study.
- HTS02 <- A note very related with the big topic.
- HTS02A <- A note treating some different but follows the line of the previous idea.
- HTS02A1 <- It's the specification of the idea.
- HTS02A1 <- It's the one separate note that is thought later.
- HTSs02 <- It's a source note.

<small>It's important know that a source note doesn't could have the same note code that the permanent note that references to it.</small>
