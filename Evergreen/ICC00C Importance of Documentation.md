# ICC00C Importance of Documentation

It's difficult to understand a code without documentation, when we face a code that doesn't have it, we need more time to analyze the code, understand what each function, class, method, and so on, is for. 
If you want to understand your code in the future and someone else get it you have to document your code.
It's useful to maintain and update the code, and when the code have documentation your learn from your errors, so you will not repeat them in the future. And finally, documentation saves time because the programmer doesn't have to explain the code to other people, because it has been explained.
