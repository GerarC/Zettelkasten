# ICC00A Technical Debts

A Technical debt is a compromise or a bad decision that will be an issue and could be so difficult to handle in the future. These debts should be changed immediately before it becomes a problem. 
Technical debts are very dangerous because they are a silent problem, this can raise in any moment and could even stop all the project until the debt is paid.

# ICC00A/1 Think in a Technical debt

Could be useful to find a [[ICC00A Technical Debts#PRG00A Technical Debts|technical debt]] before it becomes a big problem if you think on two things while you program:
- The Problem I have in this moment is the result of a unpaid debt?
- I'm creating problems to the team or even myself in this moment?
