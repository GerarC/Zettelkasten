# TDP02A Thermal Stress

**Thermal Effort** is the needed force to avoid a body to have an [[TDP02 Thermal Expansion#TDP02 Thermal Expansion|Expansion or Contraction]], the equation is $$F/A = - Y\alpha\Delta T$$ where $F/A$ is the needed force per unit Area, $Y$ is the Young Module, $\alpha$ is the [[TDP02 Thermal Expansion#TDP02a Lineal Thermal Expansion|Coefficient of Linear Expansion]] and $\Delta T$ is the variation in the [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]]. It's important to notice that the effort is inversely proportional to the variation of $T$. ^1
