# TDP01D Total Energy

The **Total Energy** of a body Symbolize **$E$** is the sum of the other types of Energies from [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]], [[MPU07 Potential Energy#MPU07 Potential Energy|Potential Energy]] to [[Nuclear Energy]]. ^1

The **Total [[TDP00 System Properties#^4|Specific]] Energy** is symbolized by **$\Large e$** and is $E$ per unit mass, i.e, $\large e=\frac{E}{m}$. Each energy is part of $E$ also has a specific form. For Example, $\large e_k =\frac{E_K}{m}$. ^2
