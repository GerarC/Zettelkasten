# TDP01C Pressure

**Pressure** is define as the force made by a fluid per unit area is symbolized by **P** and it's measured using [[#TDP01C/1 Pascal|Pascal]]. The counterpart of the pressure in solid bodies is the [[Normal Stress]]. In symbols this is $P = \large\frac{F}{A}$ ^1

The pressure made by a column of any substance is more related with deepness and [[TDP01 Density|Density]] of it than the Area it occupies. This relation between density, height and pressure is: $$P = \rho gh$$
where $g$ is the **Gravity**. How in the earth there is always the pressure of the Air then the **Absolute Pressure** of a substance is the pressure made by it and the [[#TDP01C/3 Atmosphere|Atmosphere's]] pressure, i.e.: $$P = P_a + \rho gh$$ where $P_a$ is the atm pressure. ^2

# TDP01C/1 Pascal

A **Pascal** or **Pa** is defined as the force that exerts a [[MPU04 Force|Newton]] per square [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/2 Meter|Meter]], in symbols is $1 Pa = \frac{N}{m^2}$. A pascal is too small to the most of the measures though, then is more used Kilo Pascal. ^3

# TDP01C/2 Pascal Principle

**Pascal Principle** states that if a pressure increases then, in any height below it, this pressure increases at the same rate. i.e., if a pressure in a point is $P_1 = P_2 + \rho gh$, $P_2$ increases by $p$ and the new $P_1'$ will be $P_1' = P_2 + p + \rho gh$ so $P_1' = P_1 + p$.

# TDP01C/3 Atmosphere

An **Atmosphere** is the pressure made by the air at sea level and it's equivalent to $101.325kPa$ **kilo[[#^2|Pascals]]**. ^4
