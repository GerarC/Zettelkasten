# TDP03A Conduction

**Conduction** is one of the three **Mechanisms of [[TDP03 Heat#TDP03 Heat|Heat]] transfer**, there's conduction when the heat transfers by contact so there's heat flowing from the hotter body to the colder body for a time, in other words, exits a [[#TDP03/1 Heat Current|Heat Current]]. ^1

A specific case of [[#^1|Conduction]] is when a rod is in contact with two bodies and each body has different [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]]. In this case the [[TDP03A Conduction#TDP03/1 Heat Current|Heat Current]] is given by the cross-sectional area of the rod, the difference of temperature between the bodies, the length and the material of the rod. The equation that represents this heat current is: $$H = \frac{dQ}{dt} = kA\frac{T_H - T_L}{L}$$ where $k$ is a constant known as **Thermal Conductivity**, its Units are $W/m \cdot K$ and depends on the material. and $\frac{H}{kA} = \frac{T_H - T_L}{L}$ is defined as the **Thermal Gradient**. ^2

# TDP03/1 Heat Current

**Heat Current** or **H** is defined as the rate of change of [[TDP03 Heat|Heat]] [[TDP01D Total Energy|Energy]] in time. In symbols, $H=\Large\frac{dQ}{dt}$ and it always depends on the Area of objects. Its Units are $\Large\frac{J}{s}$ [[MPU06 Work#MPU06/1 Joule|Joule]] per [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/1 Second|Second]].
