# TDP03 Heat

The **Heat**, symbolized as $Q$, is the transferred [[TDP01D Total Energy|Energy]] between two systems and their surrounding doubt to a [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] difference or a [[TDP03 Heat#TDP03/1 Phase|Change-Phase]] and its Unit of measuring is [[MPU06 Work#MPU06/1 Joule|Joule]]. ^1

Specific [[#^1|Heat]] related to a change of [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] is the needed amount energy to change the Material Temperature. It's Proportional to the Variation of Temperature and the **Mass**. The mathematical expression that represents this [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Energy]] is: $$Q = cm\Delta T$$ where $c$ is the **Specific Heat Capacity** and depends on Material. When $Q < 0$ system gets cold, when $Q > 0$ then the system gets hot. ^2

[[#^1|Heat]] related to a [[#^4|Phase-Change]] is the used Energy to change a certain amount $m$ of **Mass** of phase. It doesn't depend on the Temperature, only on the mass. This equation represents it: $$Q=\pm mL$$ where $L$ constant known as **Latent heat of fusion** and depends on the material. If $Q < 0$ there is a Solidification or Condensation and if $Q > 0$ the phase-change is a fusion or evaporation. ^3

It's so important to notice that [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] doesn't change when two types of [[#TDP03/1 Phase|Phase]] are in the system, all the [[#^1|Heat]] is used to change one phase to another. ^4

# TDP03/1 Phase

**Phase** is the specific state of a given substance, whether solid, liquid, gaseous or others. And a **Phase-Change** is when a substance pass from a phase to other. ^5
