# TDP07A Thermodynamic System

A *Thermodynamic System* is a region of the universe constituted by a significant number of particles which can interact Mechanical and Thermodynamic-ally with its surroundings. There are three types of systems: Isolated, Closed and Opened. ^1

# TDP07A/1 Isolated System

In this type of system there's no change of [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Energy]] or *Mass* with the surroundings. ^2

# TDP07A/2 Closed System

This type of system has transference of [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Energy]] but there isn't Mass transference. ^3

# TDP07A/3 Opened System

As you can guess, An opened system can have transference of [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Energy]] and *Mass*. ^4
