# TDP03D Specific Heat

**Specific Heat** is [[TDP01D Total Energy#TDP01D Total Energy|Energy]] in form of [[TDP03 Heat#TDP03 Heat|Heat]] from a **Mass** of some substance, but this energy depends on how is the process executed: constant [[TDP01E Volume#TDP01E Volume|Volume]] being &c_v& or constant [[TDP01C Pressure#TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]] being $c_p$. Using [[TDP03 Heat#^2|Heat]] equation it's possible to find $c$: $$c = \frac{Q}{m\Delta T}$$ ^1
