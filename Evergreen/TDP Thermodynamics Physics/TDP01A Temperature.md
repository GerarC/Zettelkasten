# TDP01A Temperature

**Temperature** or **T** measures "hotness" and "coldness" but is very difficult to define based on our sensations because they are so subjective, but there are other ways to define a measure. For example, the more used is Mercury-in-glass. Its [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] Unit is [[#TDP01A/1 Kelvin|Kelvin]]. ^1

# TDP01A/1 Kelvin

**Kelvin** is the [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI Unit]] to measure the [[#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]], It's born from **Celsius** where water vaporizes at $100째C$ and freeze at $0째C$. Kelvin takes the $0째K$ where all **Gases** seem to freeze and it is at $-273.15째C$. ^2

# TDP01A Thermometer

A **Thermometer** is an object used for [[#^1|Temperature]] Measurement glass bar with Mercury that uses the change of volume that Mercury suffers when Temperature varies. ^2
