# TDP06A Heat Capacities

Each *Ideal Gas* have a different **Heat Capacity** depending on its [[#TDP06A/1 Degrees of Freedom|Degrees of Freedom],

# TDP06A/1 Degrees of Freedom

**Degrees of Freedom** are the minimum number of independent coordinates needed to describe and State. The Minimum number in three dimensions is $3$, but it changes if the if the Ideal gas has more than one particle.

# TDP06A/2 Equipartition Theorem

Each [[#TDP06A/1 Degrees of Freedom|Degree of Freedom]] of the system provides a Quantity of $\frac{kT}{2}$ to the [[TDP01D Total Energy|Total Energy]] of the system.
