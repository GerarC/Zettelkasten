# TDP00 System Property

A **System Property** is any characteristic of that system. For example [[TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]], [[TDP01 Density|Density]], [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/3 Kilogram|Mass]], [[TDP01E Volume#TDP01E Volume|Volume]] and others. These properties are divided in two categories [[#^1|Intensive]] and [[#^2|Extensive]]. ^1

An **Intensive Property** is independent of the system's size. For example, [[TDP01A Temperature]], [[TDP01 Density|Density]] and [[TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]]. ^2

An **Extensive Property** depends on the size of the system, such as **Weight**, **Mass**, [[TDP01E Volume|Volume]] and so on. ^3

A **Specific Property** is an [[#^1|Extensive Property]] per mass unit, for Example, specific [[TDP01E Volume|Volume]] is $v = V/m$, these type of properties are symbolized by a lowercase letter. ^4

# TDP00/1 State Postulate

A system's state is defined using its [[#^1|Thermodynamic Properties]]. **State Postulate** indicates that the state system can be described by a minimum of [[#^2|Intensive properties]].
