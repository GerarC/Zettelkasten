# TDP07B Thermodynamic Process

 A **Thermodynamic Process** happens when one or more *Thermal Properties* ([[TDP01C Pressure|P]], [[TDP01E Volume|V]], [[TDP01A Temperature|T]]) of a [[TDP07A-Thermodynamic_System|Thermodynamic System]] change because of an interaction with its surroundings. This change on the Thermal Props is called *Change of State* and the Way is the Thermodynamic Process. ^1

# TDP07B/1 Isotherm Process

A **Isotherm** Process is that where the [[TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]] and [[TDP01E Volume|Volume]] change but there is not change on the [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]]. ^2

# TDP07B/1 Isobaric Process

An **Isobaric** Process all the *Thermal Properties* Change except for the [[TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]]. ^3

# TDP07B/1 Isocoric Process

When there is an **Isocoric** Process, Only the [[TDP01E Volume|Volume]] remains constant and [[TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]] and [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] change. ^4
