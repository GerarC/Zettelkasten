# TDP01B Thermal Equilibrium

When a body is in contact with another and they have different [[TDP01A Temperature|Temperatures]] then the hotter body will transfer its heat until the colder body have the same temperature. ^1

# TDP01B/1 Zero Law of Thermodynamics

**Zero Law** states that if two bodies are in [[#^1|Thermal Equilibrium]] with a third body, then they are in equilibrium between them. ^2
