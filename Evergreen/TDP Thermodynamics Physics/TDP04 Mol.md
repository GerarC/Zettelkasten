# TDP04 Mol

a **Mol** is a specific number of molecules independent of any  substance, A Mol always has $N_A = 6,022\times 10^23$ molecules, $N_A$ is called Avogadro number. ^1

# TDP04/1 Molar Mass

The mass of a [[#^1|Mol]] depends on the substance and it's named **Molar Mass** and its units are $g/Mol$ grams per Mol, symbolized as $M$. This is useful to represent a **Mass** quantity using just the Molar mass of the substance and how many Mols there are, i.e., $m = nM$. ^2

# TDP04/1 Molar Heat Capacity

Using [[TDP03 Heat#^2|Specific Heat]] equation and knowing about [[#^2|Molar Mass]] we can replace $m$ with $nM$, then resulting equation is $Q=nMc\Delta T$, how $M$ and $c$ depend on the material then its a constant called **Molar Heat Capacity**, symbolized by $C$ and the final equation looks like $Q=nC\Delta T$.
