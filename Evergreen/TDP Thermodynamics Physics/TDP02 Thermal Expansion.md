# TDP02 Thermal Expansion

**Thermal Expansion** or **Dilatation** is the phenomena of a material, whether solid or fluid, that expands or contracts when its [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] changes. ^1

## TDP02a Lineal Thermal Expansion

Having a *Rod* with [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/2 Meter|length]] $L_0$ and a [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] of $T_0$. If the there is a change in the Temperature, its length will vary too. This variation is proportional to the initial length and the difference in temperature, i.e., $\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$. from this equation is possible to obtain that: $$L_f = L_0(1 + \alpha\Delta T)$$ $\alpha$ is the *Coefficient of Lineal Thermal Expansion* and it measured by the inverse of [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A/1 Kelvin|Kelvin]], in symbols $K^{-1}$. ^2

## TDP02b Superficial Thermal Expansion

Works very similar to the [[#TDP02a Lineal Thermal Expansion|Lineal Expansion]] but What changes is the Area $A_0$ of the body. It means that Area variation is proportional to the change of [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] $T$. the equation that symbolizes this is $\Delta A = \gamma A_0 \Delta T$ and from it you can obtain: $$A_f = A_0(1 + \gamma\Delta T)$$ where $\gamma$ is the *Coefficient of superficial thermal expansion*. ^2

Using the [[#^1|Linear]] and [[#^2|Superficial]] equations it's possible to find the relation between $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, this relation is $\gamma = 2\alpha$ ^3

## TDP02c Volumetric Thermal Expansion

Just as [[#^1|Linear]] and [[#^2|Superficial]] there is an equation that  link [[TDP01E Volume#TDP01E Volume|Volume]] and [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]]. This equation is $\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T$, and also there is the next equation: $$V_f = V_0(1 + \beta\Delta T)$$ Where $\beta$ is the *Coefficient of Volumetric thermal expansion*. ^4

Also there is a relation between the [[#^1|Linear]] Coefficient and the [[#^4|Volumetric]] one. $\beta = 3\alpha$. ^5
