# TDP03B Convection

**Convection** is a *Mechanism of [[TDP03 Heat|Heat]] Transfer*. It's the Transfer of Heat by **Mass** Movement in a fluid, like the air or the water, usually, this mass [[MPU02A Displacement#MPU02A Displacement|Displacement]] is doubt to the difference of [[TDP01 Density|Density]], when a fluid is heated its density drops, it ups and other layer with more density downs. The [[TDP03A Conduction#TDP03/1 Heat Current|Heat Current]] of this mechanism can be found by $$H=hA(T_h -T_l)$$ Where $h$ is a constant called *Convection Coefficient*, with a Units of $W/m^2\cdot K$. ^1
