# TDP01 Density

**Density $\rho$** is the quantity of **Mass** per [[TDP01E Volume|Volume]], in symbols $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$ is the inverse of the [[TDP00 System Properties#^3|Specific]] volume, this property, generally, depends on the system's [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] and [[TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]]. ^1

Usually a [[#^1|Density]] is given relative to density of a well known substance, this is Called **Specific Gravity** or **Relative Density**. This number is the quotient of dividing the density of the body by the well known density. Is used to compare. In symbols is $SG = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{_{H2O}}}$. ^2

The Specific **Weight** can be found as the product of the density and the **Gravitational [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]]**, i.e., $\gamma_{s} = \rho g$ and its units are $(N/m^3)$. ^3
