# TDP03C Radiation

**Radiation** is other *Mechanism of [[TDP03 Heat#TDP03 Heat|Heat]] Transfer*, It's when the Heat is transferred by Electromagnetic waves just as the Solar heat, it cannot be [[TDP03B Convection#TDP03B Convection|Convection]] or [[TDP03A Conduction#TDP03A Conduction|Conduction]] because there is not any substance involved. The [[TDP03A Conduction|Heat Current]] of this mechanism can be found using the next equation: $$H = A\epsilon\sigma T^4$$ where $\epsilon$ is *emissivity of the surface*, is $(0 < \epsilon < 1)$ and depends on the material; and $\sigma$ is **Stefan-Boltzmann Constant**, a fundamental constant, it has the value of $\sigma=5.670373\times 10^{-8}W/m \cdot K^4$. This Relationship is called *Stefan-Boltzmann Law*. How a body that radiates also absorbs energy from its surroundings then a more realistic form of this type of radiation is: $$H = A\epsilon\sigma(T^4 - T_s^4)$$ where $T_s$ is the [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]] of the surroundings. ^1
