# TDP05 Equation of Ideal Gas State

For *Ideal Gases* there are three [[TDP00 System Properties#^2|Intensive]] properties that describe completely the [[TDP01B Thermal Equilibrium#TDP01B Thermal Equilibrium|Thermal Equilibrium]] of a system: [[TDP01C Pressure#TDP01C Pressure|Pressure]], [[TDP01E Volume#TDP01E Volume|Volume]] and [[TDP01A Temperature#TDP01A Temperature|Temperature]]. It's known when one of these properties is constant, the other both are always proportional between them. Using this knowledge it's obtained the next equation: $$PV = mRT$$
Where $R$ is the *Proportionality constant* and depends on the Material. ^1

But remembering [[TDP04 Mol#TDP04/1 Molar Mass|Molar mass]] we can give a new form to state's equation: $$PV = mMRT$$
as $M$ and $R$ are constant its product too, but there is something special here, it is the **Universal Constant** of the Ideal Gases. This constant is symbolized by $R_u$ so $R_u = RM$ and its value is $R_u = 8,314472 \space J/mol\cdot K$. The final equation does not change from a material to another, just depends on its [[TDP04 Mol#TDP04 Mol|Molar]] quantity: $$PV = nR_uT$$ ^2

When the number of [[TDP04 Mol#TDP04/1 Molar Mass|Mol]] is constant, then both sides of $nR_u = PV/T$ are constant and we can compare a first state of that system with a second one using the next relation $$\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_1V_1}{T_1}$$ ^3

The **Boltzmann Constant**, symbolized with $k$, is the quotient between the [[#^2|Universal Constant of Ideal Gases]] and the [[TDP04 Mol#^1|Avogadro number]], i.e., $\large k=\frac{R_u}{N_a}$ $k$ has the value of $1.380649\times 10^{-23}\space JK^{-1}$  ^4

The number of molecules of a substance can be found using [[TDP04 Mol#TDP04 Mol|Avogadro number]], because $$N = nN_A$$ Where $N$ is the number of molecules of the substance and $n$ its the amount of Mols there are. ^5

Knowing the [[#^4|Boltzmann Constant]], how many [[#^5|Molecules]] there are and using their Equations it's possible to find that $kN=nR_u$. Given this relation so we can replace it in the Equation of [[#^2|Ideal Gases]] obtaining: $$PV = NKT$$ ^6
