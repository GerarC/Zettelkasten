# ITN02A WAN

A **Wide Area Network** or its acronym **WAN** is a network infrastructure that interconnects devices through a huge geographical area and is typically administered by corporations, Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs). A WAN interconnects [[ITN02 LAN|LANs]] over a wide area from cities to continents, is often managed by multiple SPs and provides slower speed links between the LANs.
