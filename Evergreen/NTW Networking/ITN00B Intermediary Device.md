# ITN00B Intermediary Device

**Intermediary Devices** are those that connect one or more [[ITN00 Host#ITN00 Host|End Devices]] to the network and ensure that data flows across it. They use the [[ITN09 IP Address#ITN09 IP Address|destination address]] and information about the interconnections to determinate the path data should take.

An intermediary device perform some or all of these functions: repeat the signal, have information about existent pathways, notify errors and communication failures, [[ITN03A Fault Tolerance#ITN03A Fault Tolerance|address data along alternate pathways]] if the main link is broken, [[ITN03C Quality of Service#ITN03C Quality of Service|classify and manage data according to priorities]] and allow or deny data flow depending on [[ITN03D Network Security#ITN03D Network Security|security configurations]].
