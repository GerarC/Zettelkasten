# ITN03C Quality of Service

**Quality of Service** or **QoS** is a policy that allows [[ITN00B Intermediary Device|Router]] to manage the flow of data prioritizing the type of traffic, and not the content, letting flow the most important types. ^1

QoS is used when the network is congested, i.e.,  when a lot of simultaneous communications are attempted in the network, then the demand of bandwidth can exceed the available. When there is congestion, devices hold the packets in memory until resources are available again. ^2
