# ITN01 Network Representation

A **Network Representation** is a diagram that facilitates understanding of the network and how its components are located, connected and configured.

These diagrams have some special terminology to describe how devices are connected. For example, *Network Interface Card* or *NIC* which is what connects [[ITN00 Host#ITN00 Host|End Devices]] to the network, *Physical Port* that is the outlet of a [[ITN00B Intermediary Device#ITN00B Intermediary Device|Intermediary Device]] where the media is attached. And *Interfaces* that are specialized ports on a Intermediary device and connect the device to a individual network.
