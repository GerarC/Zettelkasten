# MPU07B Conservative Force

A **Conservative [[MPU04 Force|Force]]** is one that can be expressed as the change of [[MPU07 Potential Energy|Potential Energy]], is reversible, it means that can be transformed in [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] and returned to potential energy; and the [[MPU06 Work|Work]] done by a force of this type is independent of the path, only initial and final points matter.
