# MPU07A Mechanical Energy

Through [[MPU06B Work-Energy Theorem|Work-Energy Theorem]] and [[MPU07 Potential Energy#MPU07 Potential Energy|Potential Energy]] is known that $\Delta K = \Delta U$, from this, we know that $K + U$ is constant when there is not external forces acting on the system and is called **Mechanical energy**. This representation of the energy is symbolized by an $E$. ^1

Even if [[MPU07C Nonconservative Force|Nonconservative Forces]] cannot be represented using [[MPU07 Potential Energy|Potential Energy]] but can be represented as the change of the Mechanical Energy, i.e., $W_{others} = \Delta E$. ^2
