# MPU09E Energy in Rotational Motion

Just as a body moving with linear [[MPU02B Velocity|Velocity]] has [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]], a Rotating body has it too, this energy can be expressed in term of its [[MPU09A Angular Velocity|Angular Speed]] and [[MPU09D Moment of Inertia|Moment of Inertia]], This energy is $K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$. This equation gives a physical interpretation of the Moment of Inertia: With a given speed $\omega$ the greater $I$, the greater $K$. ^1
