# MPU10A Torque and Angular Acceleration

Similar to the [[MPU04 Force|Force]], the [[MPU02C Acceleration|Linear Acceleration]] and the Mass in the [[MPU04C Newton's Second Law|Newton's Second Law]], [[MPU10 Torque|Torque]] has a direct relationship between the [[MPU09B Angular Acceleration|Angular Acceleration]] and the [[MPU09D Moment of Inertia|Moment of Inertia]]. This in symbols is $\sum\tau_z=I\alpha_z$.
