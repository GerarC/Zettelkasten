# MPU00B Uncertainty

The **Uncertainty** or *Error* of a measure refers to the difference between the measured value and the real value, and it depends on the [[MPU00A Standard Unit|measurement]] method. Other way to allude to measurement method is talking about the *Significant Figures*, when you say that a value has $\large n$ significant figures you are saying that $\large n - 1$ digits are well known and the last one is uncertain. For example, when you measure with a ruler, the error or uncertainty is about a millimeter because you don't know if you measure $2.3$, $2.33$ or $2.28$
