# MPU00D Unit Conversion

Along human history there have been a lot of measurement units, to ensure all are measuring in the same way and the dimensions are respected scientists decided establish the [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]], there are still a lot of units though.

To keep all the problem with the same units sometimes you need to convert a unit to other as long as they are measuring the same aspect. To convert a unit to other you can use the [[MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems#MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems|I SEE]] method. [[MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems#^1|Identify]] the units, [[MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems#^2|set up]] and [[MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems#^3|execute]] the solution, i.e., set and do the multiplications or division you have and [[MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems#^4|evaluate]] if your conversion is correct.
