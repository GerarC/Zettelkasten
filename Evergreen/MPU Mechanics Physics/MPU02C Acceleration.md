# MPU03C Acceleration

Just as [[MPU02B Velocity|Velocity]] describes de change of the [[MPU02 Position Vector|Position]] in time, the **Acceleration** is the rate of change of the velocity in time. It's denoted as $\vec{a}$.

To obtain the average acceleration of an interval you can use: $\vec{a}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{v}_2 - \vec{v}_1}{t_2 - t_2}$.
