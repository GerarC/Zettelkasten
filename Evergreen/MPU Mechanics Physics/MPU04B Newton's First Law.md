# MPU04B Newton's First Law

The **Newton's First Law of Motion** declares that a body acted by a [[MPU04 Force#MPU04/1 Superposition of Forces|Net Force]] with magnitude zero has constant velocity and no acceleration. In symbols you can represent as: $\sum\vec{F}=0$. This state is being in equilibrium.
