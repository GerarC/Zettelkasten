# MPU08C Center of Mass

**Center of Mass** is the mean location of the mass distribution, an entire body can be interpreted as a particle thanks to it.
Is defined as $\vec{r}_{cm} = \Large\frac{\sum_i m_i\vec{r}_i}{\sum_i m_i}$. From this definition the $\vec{v}_{cm}$ can be calculated and the acceleration $\vec{a}_{cm}$ too. ^1

The [[MPU08 Momentum|Momentum]] of a real body is $\vec{P} = M\vec{v}_{cm}$. with this we have that $\sum\vec{F}_{ext} = \Large\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}$, This means that all the external forces act on the center of the mass. ^2
