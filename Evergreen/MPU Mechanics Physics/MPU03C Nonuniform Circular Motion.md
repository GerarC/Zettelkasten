# MPU03C Nonuniform Circular Motion

**Nonuniform Circular Motion** is a type of *Circular Motion* where the [[MPU02B Velocity|Velocity]] of the particle is diminishing or augmenting as well as changing *Position*. In this case, there is an Acceleration parallel to the velocity vector. This acceleration is named *Tangential Acceleration* and is denoted as $a_{tan}$. Basically is a linear acceleration as in a [[MPU02D Motion With Constant Acceleration|Motion With Constant Acceleration]].

With both acceleration [[MPU03B Normal Acceleration|Radial]] and *Tangential* you can find the total acceleration: $a = \sqrt{a_{rad}^2 + a_{tan}^2}$
