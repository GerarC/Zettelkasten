# MPU03B Normal Acceleration

**Radial acceleration** denoted by a $\vec{a}_{rad}$ or also named **Normal Acceleration** and also denoted as $\vec{a}_n$ or $\vec{a}_\perp$ is an [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]] that always is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, pointing to the center of the circle that describes the movement. It can be calculated by: $a_{rad} = \frac{v^2}{R}$
 Also can be obtained with: $a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$ ^1
