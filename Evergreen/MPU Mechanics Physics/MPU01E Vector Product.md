# MPU01E Vector Product

**Vector Product** denoted by $\vec{A}\times\vec{B}$ is a [[MPU01 Vector|Vector]] orthogonal to $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$. you can obtain its magnitude with $C = AB\sin\phi$ and its components by $C_x = A_yB_z - A_zB_y \qquad C_y = A_zB_x - A_xB_z \qquad C_z = A_xB_y - A_yB_x$.
