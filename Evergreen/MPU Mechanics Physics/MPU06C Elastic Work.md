# MPU06C Elastic Work

The **Hooke's Law**, or well "law" because is a statement about specific devices, small elongations and it's not general, says that the [[MPU04 Force|Force]] you have to apply to stretch a spring is $F_x = kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant. ^1

The spring constant is a measure of the stiffness of the spring, its [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI units]] is $N/m$. ^2

The [[MPU06 Work|Work]] done by a force when goes from the 0 (equilibrium point) to a max $X$ is $W = \frac{1}{2}kX^2$, In general, the work done in a spring is $W = \frac{1}{2}kX_2^2 + \frac{1}{2}kX_1^2$ ^3
