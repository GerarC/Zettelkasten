# MPU08 Momentum

**Linear Momentum** is a vector that represent the quantity of movement. By definition momentum is the product of the mass and the [[MPU02B Velocity|Velocity]] $\vec{p}=m\vec{v}$, its [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] is the [[MPU04 Force#MPU04/2 Newton|Newton]] per [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/1 Second|Second]] $N/s$.

[[MPU04C Newton's Second Law|Newton's Second Law]] originally says that the sum of the [[MPU04 Force|Forces]] is equal to the rate of change of momentum in time, i.e., $\sum\vec{F} = \Large\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$.

# MPU08/1 Conservation of Momentum
When two or more bodies are interacting without external forces, rates of the change of [[#MPU08 Momentum|Momenta]] of the particle's system is 0. As the the change of momentum is zero, then $\vec{P} = \sum\vec{p}_i$ is constant.
