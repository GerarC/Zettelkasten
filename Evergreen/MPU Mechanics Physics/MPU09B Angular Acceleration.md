# MPU09B Angular Acceleration

**Angular Acceleration** [[MPU01 Vector|Vector] is the ratio of [[MPU09A Angular Velocity|Angular Velocity]] in Time. Is symbolized by $\alpha_z$ and it's [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] Unit is the $rad/s^2$. Similar to the linear [[MPU02B Velocity|Velocity]] and [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]], $\alpha = \large\frac{d\omega}{dt}$.

Similar to [[MPU09B Angular Acceleration|Angular Acceleration]], the linear [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]] can be calculated as the product of the [[MPU03E Radius|Radius]] and the **Angular Acceleration**, in symbols, $a_{tan} = r\alpha$. Knowing this, so we also know that the [[MPU03B Normal Acceleration|Normal Acceleration]] can also be calculated by $a_{rad} = \omega^2R$
