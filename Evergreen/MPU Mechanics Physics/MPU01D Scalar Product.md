# MPU01D Scalar Product

**Scalar product** is denoted by $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$. With this product you will obtain a scalar, $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are [[MPU01 Vector|Vectors]] though.

you can obtain it with $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = A_xB_x + A_yB_y + A_zB_z$ or with $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = AB\cos\phi = \vec{A}\vec{B}\cos\phi$
