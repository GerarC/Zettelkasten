# MPU09D Moment of Inertia

**Moment of Inertia**, Symbolized by $I$, is the product between the mass and the distance of the mass to the rotation axis, i.e., the [[MPU03E Radius|Radius]], in symbols, $I = \sum m_i r^2_i$. This measures how difficult is to rotate a body, or the movement of all the particles in the rotating body, and its [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] unit is the $kg\cdot m^2$. The "Moment" word means that $I$ depends on the mass distribution. ^1

[[^1|Moment of Inertia]] can be calculated with the sum of the all the particles mass and its distance to the rotation axis, if the body is continuous then the sum is an integral $I = \int r^2\space dm$. Whether it's a three dimensional body so is easiest to express $dm$ in terms of volume $I = \int r^2\rho\space dV$, where $\rho = dm/dV$ is the density of the body. Finally if the body has uniform density $\rho$ can get out of the Integral. ^2
