# MPU04C Newton's Second Law

The **Newton's Second Law** says that if the external [[MPU04 Force#MPU04/1 Superposition of Forces|Net Force]] acts on a body, the body [[MPU02C Acceleration|Accelerates]]. This acceleration has the same direction as the Net force and its magnitude depends on the inertial mass of the body. In symbols is $\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$.
