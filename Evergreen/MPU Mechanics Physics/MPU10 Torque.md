# MPU10 Torque

[[MPU04 Force|Forces]] can affect a body's translational motion, and also can affect its rotational motion. **Torque** of **Moment of Force** is a [[MPU01 Vector|Vector]] that measures the tendency of a force to cause or change the [[MPU09C Rotating With Constant Angular Acceleration|Rotational]] Motion of a body, is symbolized by a $\tau_z$ and its [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] unit is $km\cdot m$. ^1

To calculate the Torque done by a force about a point $O$, depends on the perpendicular distance between the point and the line of action of the force $\tau = Fl$, where $l$ is called *lever arm* and is usually $l = r\sin\theta$, but is better see as the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis to the force action line. In General torque is, by definition $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$ ^2
