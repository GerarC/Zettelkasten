# MPU01B Vector Addition

To add or subtract two or more [[MPU01 Vector|Vectors]] you can can decompose on [[MPU01A Vector Components|Compontents]] and for each axis add or subtract all the the components, you will obtain the component of that axis of the final vector and with all the components you will obtain its [[MPU01A Vector Components#MPU01A/1 Obtain a Vector through its Components|Magnitude and direction]].
