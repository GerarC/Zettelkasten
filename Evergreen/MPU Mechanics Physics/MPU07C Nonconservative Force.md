# MPU07C Nonconservative Force

Some [[MPU04 Force|Forces]] not conserve the [[MPU07A Mechanical Energy|Mechanical Energy] and this loss cannot be recovered anymore, this type of force is known as **Nonconservative Force** or in some cases **Dissipative Force**. Some nonconservative forces can increase the mechanical energy.
