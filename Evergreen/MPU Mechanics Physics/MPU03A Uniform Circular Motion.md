# MPU03A Uniform Circular Motion

An **Uniform Circular Motion** is when a particle moves along a circle with constant velocity. It has an [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]] though, but this acceleration is Perpendicular to the velocity changing its *direction* but not its *magnitude* also known as [[MPU03B Normal Acceleration|Radial Acceleration]]
