# MPU04E Free-Body Diagram

A **Free-Body Diagrams** is a draw in which you specifies the external [[MPU04 Force|Forces]] acting on the body and their directions. This type of diagrams are essential to identify the relevant forces and resolve exercises. ^1

To draw a diagram of this type first you have to identify which body you will represent, determine which are the forces acting on the body and their directions. And then draw it. ^2
