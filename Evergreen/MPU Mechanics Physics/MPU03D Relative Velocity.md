# MPU03D Relative Velocity

The relative [[MPU02B Velocity|Velocity]] is when a object moves with a velocity in a system, but for an external observer has a different velocity. ^1

The equation that describes this type of velocity is $\vec{v}_{P/O} = \vec{v}_{P/A} + \vec{v}_{B/O}$. It means, the velocity of a body P relative to an Observer O (or body) is equal to the velocity observed by O of the body A plus the velocity of P relative to A. ^2
