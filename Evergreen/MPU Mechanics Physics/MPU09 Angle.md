# MPU09 Angle

An **Angle** is the space between two intersecting lines or [[MPU01 Vector|Vectors]]. It's symbolized by Greek letters. ^1

In physics is used to measure the [[MPU03A Uniform Circular Motion|Circular Movement]], usually using [[#MPU09/1 Radian|Radians]] as Unit. ^2

# MPU09/1 Radian

Is the Unit used to measure circular-type movement, Is obtained dividing the [[MPU09A Angular Velocity#MPU09A/1 Arc|Arc]] with its [[MPU03E Radius|Radius]] to an axis, in symbols, $\theta = \Large\frac{s}{r}$. A Radian is equivalent to $57.3\largeÂ°$. ^3
