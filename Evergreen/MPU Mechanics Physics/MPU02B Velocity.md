# MPU02B Velocity

**Velocity** is a [[MPU01 Vector|Vector]] that represents how much [[MPU02A Displacement|Displacement]] there is in a specific time. It's denoted as $\vec{v}$.

To obtain the average Velocity of an interval of time just use: $\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1}{t_2 - t_2}$. It couldn't be exact at least the velocity is constant thought.

The instantaneous Velocity is the "real" value of the velocity in a specific point and not of an interval, is found using: $\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$.
