# MPU09A Angular Velocity

**Angular Velocity** [[MPU01 Vector|vector]] is the rate of change of the [[MPU09 Angle#MPU09 Angle|Angle]] in time. It's measure in rad per second $rad/s$ and is symbolized by an $\omega_z$, all this means that $\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$. This vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation, and this axis is symbolized by an $z$. ^1

Using the relation between the [[#MPU09A/1 Arc|Arc]] and the [[MPU03E Radius|Radius]] we know that the Linear [[MPU02B Velocity|Speed]] is the product of the **Angular Velocity** and the Radius, i.e., $v = r\omega$. ^2

# MPU09A/1 Arc

The **Arc** is the distance between two points in the edge of a circle. Can be calculated multiplying the [[MPU03E Radius|Radius]] of the circumference and the [[MPU09 Angle|Angle]] made by the both points, i.e., $s = r\theta$. ^3
