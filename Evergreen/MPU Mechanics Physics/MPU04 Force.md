# MPU04 Force

A **Force** is a [[MPU01 Vector|Vector]] that represents the interaction between two body or a body with its environment, it can be a pull or a push, denoted by $\vec{F}$. The unit in which the force is measured is the [[#MPU04/2 Newton Unit|Newton]].

# MPU04/1 Superposition of Forces

All the [[#MPU04 Force|force]] acting in one body can be represented by an unique force named *Net Force*, this force is the sum of the all forces, i.e., $\vec{F}_{net} = \sum\vec{F}$.

# MPU04/2 Newton Unit

One **Newton Unit** is which measures the force needed to give an [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]] of $1m/s^2$ to a body with a mass of $1kg$. In symbols: $1N = 1kg\cdot m/s^2$.
