# MPU07 Potential Energy

**Potential Energy** is the energy held by a body because of its relative position to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge and others. and it's associated with the work done by [[MPU07B Conservative Force|Conservative Forces]]. The most known potential energy are [[MPU07 Potential Energy#MPU07/1 Gravitational Potential Energy|Gravitational]] and [[MPU07 Potential Energy#MPU07/2 Elastic Potential Energy|Elastic]] potentials. ^1

In general, the work [[MPU06 Work|Work]] done by a [[MPU07B Conservative Force|Conservative Force]] [[MPU04 Force|force]] can be expressed as the negative change of the potential energy, in symbols, $W = \Delta U$. ^3

As a [[MPU04 Force|Force]] is the work done in a distance can also be calculated as the negative rate of change of potential energy in a distance, in symbols $F = -\Large\frac{dU}{dx}$

# MPU07/1 Gravitational Potential Energy

**Gravitational [[#MPU07 Potential Energy|Potential Energy]]** is that which is related with a body weight and its height above a referential point. When the body is falling, the potential energy transforms in [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]]. This potential in symbols is $U_{grav} = mg\Delta y$. ^2

# MPU07/2 Elastic Potential Energy

**Elastic [[#MPU07 Potential Energy|Potential Energy]]** is the energy saved in a elastic body when is press. Using the [[MPU06C Elastic Work|Hooke's Law]], the elastic potential of a spring is $U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$ ^4
