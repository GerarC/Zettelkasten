# MPU01A Vector Components

A **Vector Component** is the *Magnitude* of the projection of the [[MPU01 Vector#MPU01 Vector|Vector]] on an axis of the coordinate system you are using. For example two dimensions or three and so on. In the case two axis as is common in physics problem you find the components using the Pythagoras theorem. For example, to calculate the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector $\vec{A}$ you use the next expressions: $Ax = A \cos\theta$ and $Ay = A \sin\theta$. ^1


# MPU01A/1 Obtain a Vector through its Components 

If you have the components but not the Vector Magnitude you can obtain it in the next way: $A = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2}$. If you want to know the direction of the vector using its components in a 2 dimension system you have to use: $\theta = \arctan{\frac{A_y}{A_x}}$. ^2
