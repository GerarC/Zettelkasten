# MPU09F Parallel Axis Theorem

A body has infinite Moments of Inertia, The **Parallel Axis Theorem** says there is a simple relationship between a $I_{cm}$ about an axis through the [[MPU08C Center of Mass|Center of Mass]] of the body and any other $I_p$ parallel to it. This relation is $I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2$, Where $d$ is the distance of $I_p$ to $I_{cm}$. ^1
