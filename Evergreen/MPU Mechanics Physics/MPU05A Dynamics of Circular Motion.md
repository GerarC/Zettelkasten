# MPU05A Dynamics of Circular Motion

To study the **Dynamics of Circular Motion** is necessary to know about the *Newton's Laws*, Make the sum of the forces in the object and apply it to [[MPU03A Uniform Circular Motion|Circular Motion]]. As the [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]] of this type of movement is the [[MPU03B Normal Acceleration|Radial Acceleration]] then the newton's equation is $F_{net} = ma_{rad} = m\frac{v^2}{R}$. And it's valid for any path that is part of a circular arc.
