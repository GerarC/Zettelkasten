# MPU01C Unit Vector

A **Unit Vector** is a [[MPU01 Vector|Vector]] with *Magnitude* $1$ and *Direction* in only one axis. Is often represented by a lower case letter with a hat, like $\hat{k}$. It is so useful to work with [[MPU01A Vector Components#MPU01A Vector Components|Vector Components]] because you can obtain any vector multiplying all the unit vectors of the coordinate system with scalars and adding between them.

In base 2 the two [[MPU01C Unit Vector#MPU01C Unit Vector|Unit Vectors]] are $\hat{i}$  for the x-axis and $\hat{j}$ for the y-axis.
