# MPU02E Free Falling

A **Free Falling Body** is the  most common example you can find about the [[MPU02D Motion With Constant Acceleration|Motion With Constant Acceleration]], here the [[MPU02C Acceleration|Acceleration]] is a constant value given by the *Gravity*: $g = 9.80 m/s^2$. How it's a Motion with constant acceleration uses the same [[MPU02D Motion With Constant Acceleration#^2|equations]] but changing the used axis for y.
