# MPU06A Kinetic Energy

The **Kinetic Energy** is the [[MPU06 Work|Work]] done to accelerate a particle from the rest to its actual [[MPU02B Velocity|Speed]], It's symbolized by $K$ and is calculated with $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. This energy can change even if there is no external [[MPU04 Force|Force]] acting on the system. It has the same [[MPU00A Standard Unit|Units]] of the Work.
