# MPU05 Friction

**Friction** is the [[MPU04 Force|Force]] made by the contact between a body and a surface or fluid. Its parallel to the surface and usually has opposite direction to the velocity.

# MPU05/1 Kinetic Friction

This type [[MPU05 Friction|Friction]] acts when the body moves over a surface, it's denote by $\vec{f}_k$, this friction is orthogonal to *Normal* Force and its magnitude also depends on Normal's Magnitude, i.e., $f_k=\mu_kn$ being $\mu_k$ the friction coefficient. This type of friction obstructs the movement but not block the body.

# MPU05/2 Static Friction

This type of friction acts when a force is trying to move the body, blocking the body and not letting it to move. just as [[#MPU05/1 Kinetic Friction|Kinetic Friction]] depends on the *Normal* Force, also depends on the net force though, the more it push, the more magnitude the friction has. This friction has a acting interval $[0, (f_s)_{max}]$ where $(f_s)_{max}$ is given by $(f_s)_{max}=\mu_sn$. When the force pass the max friction the object begins to move and the Kinetic friction to act.
