# MPU00A Standard Unit

International System or *SI* for its french acronym has established a **Standard System** of Units to measure. This units have bases on universal constants such as the light, or microwaves of a certain type of isotope. Those units should be used by all the scientist to make understandable to others, instead of use weird local metrics.

# MPU00A/1 Second
The unit used for measure the *Time* by the [[#MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] is the **Second**, is symbolized by a *S* and is defined as the time required for $9,192,631,770$ cycles of the microwave radiation emitted in the transition between the lowest energy states of a cesium 133 isotope atom.

# MPU00A/2 Meter
The **Meter** is the unit used by [[#MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] to measure a *Length*, is denoted by a *m* and is the distance traveled by the light in the void in $1/299,792,458$ [[#MPU00A/1 Second|Second]]

# MPU00A/3 Kilogram
The standard unit to measure the *Mass* is the **Kilogram**, this unit was defined as the Mass of a particular cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. But know is define in terms of [[#MPU00A/1 Second|seconds]] and [[#MPU00A/2 Meter|meters]]
