# MPU04D Newton's Third Law

**Newton's Third Law** says that if a body exerts a [[MPU04 Force|Force]] over other body, the other body also exerts a force with the same magnitude but opposite direction. I.e., $\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$. It doesn't matter if one body is inanimate.
