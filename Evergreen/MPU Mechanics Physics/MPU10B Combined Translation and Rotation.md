# MPU10B Combined Translation and Rotation

A rigid body can [[MPU02A Displacement|Displace]] its [[MPU08C Center of Mass|Center of Mass]] and also [[MPU09C Rotating With Constant Angular Acceleration|Rotate about it]], both types of movement can be expressed independently even if are happening at the same time. ^1

[[#^1|This]] can be seen when the [[MPU06A Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] is calculated, because a part of the energy is for translation and the other is for rotation, i.e., $K = \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2$. ^2
