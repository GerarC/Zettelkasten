# MPU00C Base to Solve Physics Problems

The strategy to solve a physics problem in general is based on four steps: [[#^1|Identify]], [[#^2|Set up]], [[#^3|Execute]], and finally [[#^4|Evaluate]]. Remember this method with the **I SEE** acronym.

**Identify** *the relevant concepts*, which is the initial condition, the target variables, identify known and unknown variables and see if you have to obtain a numerical value or an algebraic expression. ^1

**Set up** *the problem*, make a sketch of the situation, list known and unknown quantities, choose equations you will use and decide how you'll use them, and it's important that you put the problem in words and translate the words in symbols. For example, What is the time when the body reach its highest point? is translated as: which is $t$ when $v_y = 0$? ^2

**Execute** *the solution*, basically "do the math", use the equations to calculate the answer you need. ^3

**Evaluate** *the answer*, analyze if the units are right, if your estimate accords with the result you obtained and what happen with the values if it is an algebraic value. ^4
