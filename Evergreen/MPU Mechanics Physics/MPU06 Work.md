# MPU06 Work

**Work** is defined as the [[MPU01D Scalar Product|Scalar Product]] of a [[MPU04 Force|Force]] and a [[MPU02A Displacement|Displacement]], in symbols is $W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{s}$. The work is parallel to the movement. In general, The work is $W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_x\space dx$. And is measured by [[#MPU06/1 Joule|Joule]] ^1

If the Force is has a direction in the same direction of the movement, then the Work is positive, if the direction is opposite, the work is negative and if the force is orthogonal, then there are no work done by it. ^2

The total work of a body is the sum of the work of every force acting on the body. ^3

# MPU06/1 Joule

**Joule** or **J** is the [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] Unit used to measure the Work and the Energies. A joule is A Newton per Meter $1J = 1 N\cdot m$. In Words, is the Work done by a force of one [[MPU04 Force#MPU04/2 Newton|Newton]] to [[MPU02A Displacement|displace]] a mass through a [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/2 Meter|Meter]]
