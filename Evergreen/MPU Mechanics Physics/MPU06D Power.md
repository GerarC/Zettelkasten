# MPU06D Power

[[MPU06 Work|Work]] makes no reference to time, so **Power**, by definition, is the quantity of [[MPU06 Work|Work]] done in a given time, in symbols $P = \frac{dW}{dt}$. The [[MPU00A Standard Unit|SI]] unit of the power is the [[#MPU06D/1 Watt|Watt]]. ^1

As the Work is the a [[MPU04 Force|Force]] in a by a [[MPU02A Displacement|Displacement]], power also can be expressed as $P = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}$. ^2

# MPU06D/1 Watt

A **Watt** or **W** is a [[MPU06 Work#MPU06/1 Joule|Joule]] per [[MPU00A Standard Unit#MPU00A/1 Second|Second]], i.e., How much work is done in a time. ^3
