# MPU01 Vector
A **Vector** is a Value, or *Magnitude* (how much) that also has a *Direction*. It's often represented as a letter with an arrow over it, like $\vec{A}$. The magnitude value is represented using only the letter, following the example would be $A$ and the direction is given by an angle.

you can say that two vectors are equal if their *Magnitude* and *Direction* are the same, the position doesn't matter.
