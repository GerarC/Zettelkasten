## **Quote**
Securing the network infrastructure includes physically securing devices that provide network connectivity and preventing unauthorized access to the management software that resides on them
Network administrators must also protect the information contained within the packets being transmitted over the network, and the information stored on network attached devices.

there are three primary requirements.
-   **Confidentiality** - Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data.
-   **Integrity** - Data integrity assures users that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination.
-   **Availability** - Data availability assures users of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users.
