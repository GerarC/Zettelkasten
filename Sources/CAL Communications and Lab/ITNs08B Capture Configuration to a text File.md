# ITNs08B Capture Configuration to a text File

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.5.

## **Quote**
Configuration files can also be saved and archived to a text document. This sequence of steps ensures that a working copy of the configuration file is available for editing or reuse later.

The text file created can be used as a record of how the device is currently implemented. The file could require editing before being used to restore a saved configuration to a device.

To restore a configuration file to a device:

**Step 1.** Enter global configuration mode on the device.

**Step 2.** Copy and paste the text file into the terminal window connected to the switch.

## **Summary**
<!-- Resume of the idea with the context of the quote. -->
