# ITNs07A Password Guidelines

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.4.

## **Quote**
All networking devices should limit administrative access by securing privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and remote Telnet access with passwords. In addition, all passwords should be encrypted and legal notifications provided.

When choosing passwords, use strong passwords that are not easily guessed. There are some key points to consider when choosing passwords:

-   Use passwords that are more than eight characters in length.
-   Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences.
-   Avoid using the same password for all devices.
-   Do not use common words because they are easily guessed.

## **Summary**
