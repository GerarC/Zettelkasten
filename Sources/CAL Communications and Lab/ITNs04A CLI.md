# ITNs04A CLI

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.1.

## **Quote**
> When using a CLI, the user interacts directly with the system in a text-based environment by entering commands on the keyboard at a command prompt, as shown in the example. The system executes the command, often providing textual output. The CLI requires very little overhead to operate. However, it does require that the user have knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the system.

> However, GUIs may not always be able to provide all the features available with the CLI. GUIs can also fail, crash, or simply not operate as specified. For these reasons, network devices are typically accessed through a CLI. The CLI is less resource intensive and very stable when compared to a GUI.

## **Summary**
the **CLI** is a text based environment through the user can enter instructions to use and configure a *device* using only the keyboard at the command prompt. This type of Environments requires few resources to function. But it requires knowledge of the structure of the system commands.

But even if a GUI is easier than a CLI, it can also fail, crash or not operate as you want. So the *Network* devices are often typically accessed through CLI.
