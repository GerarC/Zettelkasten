# ITNs04A CLI

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.1.

## **Quote**
When using a CLI, the user interacts directly with the system in a text-based environment by entering commands on the keyboard at a command prompt, as shown in the example. The system executes the command, often providing textual output. The CLI requires very little overhead to operate. However, it does require that the user have knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the system.
