# ITNs01 Network representations

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.3.

## **Quote**
Network architects and administrators must be able to show what their networks will look like. They need to be able to easily see which components connect to other components, where they will be located, and how they will be connected. Diagrams of networks often use symbols

A diagram provides an easy way to understand how devices connect in a large network. This type of “picture” of a network is known as a topology diagram. The ability to recognize the logical representations of the physical networking components is critical to being able to visualize the organization and operation of a network.

specialized terminology is used to describe how each of these devices and media connect to each other:

-   **Network Interface Card (NIC)** - A NIC physically connects the end device to the network.
-   **Physical Port** - A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media connects to an end device or another networking device.
-   **Interface** - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces.

**Note**: The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.
