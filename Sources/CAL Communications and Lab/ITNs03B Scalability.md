# ITNs03B Scalability

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.r.

## **Quote**
A scalable network expands quickly to support new users and applications. It does this without degrading the performance of services that are being accessed by existing users. The figure shows how a new network is easily added to an existing network. These networks are scalable because the designers follow accepted standards and protocols. This lets software and hardware vendors focus on improving products and services without having to design a new set of rules for operating within the network.
