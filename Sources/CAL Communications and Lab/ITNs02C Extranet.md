## **Quote**
An organization may use an extranet to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organizationâ€™s data. Here are some examples of extranets:
-   A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors
-   A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make appointments for their patients
-   A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district
