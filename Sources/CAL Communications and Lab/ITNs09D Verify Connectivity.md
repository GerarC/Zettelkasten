# ITNs09D Verify Connectivity

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.8.

## **Quote**
> ## Test the Interface Assignment
Using the CLI, you will verify the interfaces and the addresses of the switches and routers in your network.
In the same way that you use commands and utilities like **ipconfig** to verify the network configuration of a PC host, you also use commands to verify the interfaces and address settings of intermediary devices like switches and routers.

> ## Test End-to-End
The **ping** command can be used to test connectivity to another device on the network or a website on the internet.

## **Summary**
verify connectivity:
- To test the interface assignment of End Devices use commands of the End device like `ipconfig` in windows, and `ifconfig` or `ip address` in Linux.
- In Network Devices use commands like `show running-config`.
- If you want test the connectivity End to End use the `ping` command.
