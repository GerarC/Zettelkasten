## **Quote**
A WAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider.

**WANs**
The figure shows a WAN which interconnects two LANs. A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

WANs have specific characteristics:
-   WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
-   WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
-   WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.
