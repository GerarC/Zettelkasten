# ITNs06A Hotkeys And Shortcuts

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.3.

## **Quote**
> Commands and keywords can be shortened to the minimum number of characters that identify a unique selection. For example, the **configure** command can be shortened to **conf** because **configure** is the only command that begins with **conf**. An even shorter version, **con**, will not work because more than one command begins with **con**. Keywords can also be shortened.
