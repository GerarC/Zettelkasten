# ITNs00C Network Media

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.2.

## **Quote**
> Communication transmits across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

> Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices, as shown in the figure:
> -   **Metal wires within cables** - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
> -   **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)** - Data is encoded into pulses of light.
> -   **Wireless transmission** - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

> The four main criteria for choosing network media are these:
> - What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
> - What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
> - What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
> - What is the cost of the media and installation?
