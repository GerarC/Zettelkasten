# SZPs07D Conservative Forces

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 7.3.

## **Quote**
> A force that offers this opportunity of two-way conversion between kinetic and potential energies is called a conservative force. We have seen two examples of conservative forces: the gravitational force and the spring force.

> Anything that we deposit in the energy “bank” can later be withdrawn 
without loss. Another important aspect of conservative forces is that if a body follows different paths from point 1 to point 2, the work done by a conservative force is the same for all of these paths

> In summary, the work done by a conservative force has four properties:
> 1. It can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final values of a potential-energy function.
> 2. It is reversible.
> 3. It is independent of the path of the body and depends on only the starting and ending points.
> 4. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero.

## **Summary**
Conservative Force:
- A conservative force can be expressed as the change of the potential energy.
- With this type of forces the energy can be deposited like in a bank and can later be withdrawn without loss.
- The work done by a conservative force is independent of the followed path, only the initial and final points.
