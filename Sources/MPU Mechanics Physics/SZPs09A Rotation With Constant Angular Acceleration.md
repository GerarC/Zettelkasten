# SZPs09A Rotation With Constant Angular Acceleration

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 9.2.

## **Quote**
> $\omega_z = \omega_{0z} + \alpha_zt$
$\theta = \theta_0 + \omega_{0z} + \frac{1}{2}\alpha_zt^2$
$\theta - \theta_0 = \frac{1}{2}(\omega_{0z} + \omega_z)t$
$\omega_z^2 = \omega_{0z}^2 + 2\alpha_z(\theta - \theta_0)$

## **Summary**
Rotation With Constant Angular Acceleration:
- This type of movement is so similar to the MRUA.
- But it's also possible calculate tangent velocity and normal acceleration
