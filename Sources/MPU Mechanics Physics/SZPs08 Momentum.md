> #### Newton's Second Law in Terms of Momentum
Newton’s second law says that the net force $\sum\vec{F}$ acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of the product of the particle’s mass and velocity. We’ll call this product the momentum, or linear momentum, of the particle:
$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$

$\sum\vec{F} = \Large{\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}}$

> The net force (vector sum of all forces) acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of momentum of the particle. This is the form in which Newton originally stated his second law (although he called momentum the “quantity of motion”).


## **Summary**
- The original Newton's Second law say that the Sum of the forces is the change of the product of the mass and velocity in a time.
- This product is called Momentum: $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$
- $\sum\vec{F} =\Large\frac{md\vec{v}}{dt}$ and $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$
- $\sum\vec{F} = \Large{\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}}$
