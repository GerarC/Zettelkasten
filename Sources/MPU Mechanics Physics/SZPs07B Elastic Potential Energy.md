# SZPs07B Elastic Potential Energy

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 7.2.

## **Quote**
> In many situations we encounter potential energy that is not gravitational in nature. 
$F = kx$

> We found in Section 6.3 that the work we must do on the spring to move one end from an elongation $x_1$ to a different elongation $x_2$ is:
$W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2_2 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2_1$ (work done on a spring)

> we find that in a displacement from $x_1$ to $x_2$ the spring does an amount of work $W_el$ given by:
$W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2_1 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2_2$ (work done by a spring)
The subscript “el” stands for elastic.

> we define it to be the elastic potential energy:
$U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
> So
$W_{el} = - \Delta U_{el} = U_{el,\space 1} - U_{el,\space 2}$

> $K_1 + U_{el,\space 1} = K_2 + U_{el,\space 2}$


## **Summary**
Elastic Potential Energy:
- This is the energy saved in a Elastic body such a spring.
- $F = kx$
- the Potential energy of a spring is: $U_{el} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
- So the Work is  $W_{el} = - \Delta U_{el} = U_{el,\space 1} - U_{el,\space 2}$
- And the total energy of the system is $K_1 + U_{el,\space 1} = K_2 + U_{el,\space 2}$
