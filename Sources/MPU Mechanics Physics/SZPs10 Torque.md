## **Quote**
> We know that forces acting on a body can affect its translational motion- that is, the motion of the body as a whole through space. Now we want to learn which aspects of a force determine how effective it is in causing or changing rotational motion. The magnitude and direction of the force are important, but so is the point on the body where the force is applied. 
*The quantitative measure of the tendency of a force to cause or change a bodyâ€™s rotational motion is called torque*

> To cause a rotation about $O$ depends on its magnitude $F_1$. It also depends on the perpendicular distance l1 between point $O$ and the line of action of the force 
$\tau = Fl$

> There are three ways to calculate the torque of *$\vec{F}$*:
> 1. Find the lever arm $l$ and use $\tau = Fl$.
> 2. Determine the angle $\phi$ between the vectors $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$; the lever arm is $r\sin\phi$, so $\tau = rF\sin\phi$.
> 3. Represent $\vec{F}$ in terms of a radial component $F_{rad}$ along the direction of $\vec{r}$ and a tangential component $F_{tan}$ at right angles, perpendicular to $\vec{r}$. (We call this component tangential because if the body rotates, the point where the force acts moves in a circle, and this component is tangent to that circle.) Then $F_{tan} = F \sin\phi$ and $\tau = r(F\sin\phi)\space=\space F_{tan}r$. The component $F_{rad}$ produces no torque with respect to O because its lever arm with  respect to that point is zero

> #### Torque As a Vector
Angular velocity and angular acceleration can be represented as vectors; the same is true for torque. To see how to do this, note that the quantity $rF\sin\phi$ is the magnitude of the vector product $\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$.
$\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$


## **Summary**
Torque:
- Forces can affect a body's translational motion, but also can its rotational motion.
- This depends on the point where the force is applied.
- Torque is a vector that measures the tendency of a force to cause or change the rotational motion o a body.
- Symbolized as $\tau$.
- SI unit is $kg\cdot m$
- To cause a rotation about a point O, depends on the magnitude of the force and its distance between the point and the line of action: $\tau = Fl$.
- In general Torque is, by definition $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r}\times\vec{F}$.
