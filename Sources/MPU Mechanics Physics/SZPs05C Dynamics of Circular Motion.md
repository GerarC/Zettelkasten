# SZPs05C Dynamics of Circular Motion

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 5.4.

## **Quote**
We can also express the centripetal acceleration $a_{rad}$ in terms of the period $T$, the time for one revolution:
 
$\large T = \frac{2\pi R}{v}$ -> replacing in $a_{rad}=\frac{v^2}{R}$

$a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

The magnitude of the radial acceleration is given by arad = v2>R, so the magnitude Fnet of the net force on a particle with mass m in uniform circular motion must be
$F_{net} = ma_{rad} = m \frac{v^2}{R}$

Uniform circular motion can result from any combination of forces, just so the net force $\sum\vec{F}$ is always directed toward the center of the circle and has a constant magnitude. Note that the body need not move around a complete circle: is valid for any path that can be regarded as part of a circular arc.

## **Summary**
Period:
- $T = \frac{2\pi R}{v}$.
- The time that takes to do a round.

Radial Acceleration:
- Can be express in term of the period.
- $a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

Dynamics of circular motion:
- It means to apply Newton's Laws to a uniform circular movement.
- $F_{net} = ma_{rad} = m \frac{v^2}{R}$
- It's valid for any path that is part of a circular arc.
- always directed toward the center of the circle.
