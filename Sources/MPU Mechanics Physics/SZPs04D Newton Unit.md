# SZPs04D Newton Unit

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.3.

## **Quote**
The SI unit of mass is the kilogram. We mentioned in Section 1.3 that the kilogram is officially defined to be the mass of a cylinder of platinumâ€“iridium alloy kept in a vault near Paris (Fig. 1.4). We can use this standard kilogram, along with Eqs. (4.4), to define the newton: One newton is the amount of net force that gives an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared to a body with a mass of 1 kilogram.
$$1N = 1kg\cdot m/s^2$$

## **Summary**
Newton Unit:
- This unit describe the force needed to give to a body of $1Kg$ a acceleration of $1m/s^2$
- $1N = 1kg\cdot m/s^2$
