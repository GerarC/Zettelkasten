## **Quote** 
> To make accurate, reliable measurements, we need units of measurement  that do not change and that can be duplicated by observers in various locations.  The system of units used by scientists and engineers around the world is commonly called “the metric system,” but since 1960 it has been known officially as  the **International System**, or **SI** (the abbreviation for its French name, *Système  International*). Appendix A gives a list of all SI units as well as definitions of the most fundamental units. *Page 29*

> #### Time 
> It is based on an atomic clock, which uses the energy difference between  the two lowest energy states of the cesium atom (133Cs). When bombarded by  microwaves of precisely the proper frequency, cesium atoms undergo a transition from one of these states to the other. One **second** (abbreviated s) is defined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 cycles of this microwave radiation. *Page 29*

> #### Length
> Hence the new definition if the **meter** (abbreviated m) is the distance that light travels in vacuum in 1>299,792,458 second. This modern definition provides a much more precise standard of length than the one based on a wave-length of light. *Page 30*

> #### Mass
> The standard of mass, the **kilogram** (abbreviated kg), is defined to be the mass of  a particular cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept at the International Bureau  of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, near Paris. An atomic standard  of mass would be more fundamental, but at present we cannot measure masses  on an atomic scale with as much accuracy as on a macroscopic scale. The *gram* (which is not a fundamental unit) is 0.001 kilogram. *Page 30*

### Kilogram Wikipedia Page
The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10−34 when expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to $kg⋅m^2⋅s^{−1}$, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of $c$ and $\Delta v_{Cs}$.


## **Summary**
Through the human history there have been a lot of measurement units, but not all of these are reliable. To do Physics the metrics are so important, then we needed to standardize the units of measurement. The standardize units are the called **International System** or **SI**. It defines and uses some units, but the most basics are *Seconds*, *Meters* and *Mass*.

**Time**
The units used for the time by **SI** is the *second (s)*, a second is the time required for 9,192,631,770 cycles of the microwave radiation emitted in the transition of the between the lowest energy states of a cesium 133 isotope atom.

**Length**
To measure a length, the **SI** use the unit of *Meter (m)*, a meter is the distance traveled by the light in $1/2999,792,458$ seconds

**Mass**
The standard of the mass unit measurement is the *Kilogram (kg)*, this unit was defined as the mass of a particular cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. Nowadays is other definition but is so hard to explain for me in the moment.
