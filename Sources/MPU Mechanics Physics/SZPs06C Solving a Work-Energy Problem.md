## **Summary**
Work-Energy Problem strategy:
- As always, use I SEE solving pattern.
- Identify: Use it always when you want to relate a speed $v_1$ with another speed $v_2$.
- Set up: Identify initial and final positions, draw the free-body diagram, Choose the coordinate system, and list what you have and what you want.
- Execute: Calculate The work done by each force (Or if you want calculate the net force and find the work done by it), and Finally use the Theorem equation.
- Evaluate: check if your answer is make sense, Kinetic energy cannot be negative, use it as a red flag.
