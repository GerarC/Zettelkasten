## **Summary**
The strategy of problem solving is the next, first you *Identify* the relevant concepts, i.e., the initial condition, known and unknown variables, then *Set up* the problem, It means, knowing the relevant things of the exercise, then choose the equations you will use and how you'll use them to solve the problem. Once you have set the problem up, *Execute* the solution, basically it's "do the map". And finally you just need to *Evaluate* the answer, if it's correct or there is any discrepancy and see what happen with the values or the algebraic expressions.

To remember this method is useful use the acronym **I SEE**.
