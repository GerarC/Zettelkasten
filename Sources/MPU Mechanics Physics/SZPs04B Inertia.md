# SZPs04B Inertia

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.2.

## **Quote**
> The tendency of a body to keep moving once it is set in motion is called **inertia**.

> **Mass and Force**
Our results mean that for a given body, the ratio of the magnitude $|\sum\vec{F}|$ of the net force to the magnitude $a=|\vec{a}|$ of the acceleration is constant, regardless of the magnitude of net force. We call this ratio the **inertial mass**, or simply the **mass**, of the body and denote it by *m*. That is,
$$m = \sum\frac{|\vec{F}|}{a} \quad or \quad |\vec{F}|=ma \quad or \quad a = \frac{|\vec{F}|}{m}$$

## **Summary**
Inertia:
- It's the tendency of a body to stay in its state.
- i.e., if it is in rest, it will try to keep in rest.
- and if it is moving, it try to keep moving.
- this depends on the inertial mass
