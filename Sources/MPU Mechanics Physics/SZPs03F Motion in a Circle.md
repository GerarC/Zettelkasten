# SZPs03F Motion in a Circle

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 3.4.

## **Quote**
> When a particle moves along a curved path, the direction of its velocity changes. As we saw in Section 3.2, this means that the particle must have a component of acceleration perpendicular to the path, even if its speed is constant.

> **Uniform Circular Motion**
When a particle moves in a circle with constant speed, the motion is called uniform circular motion.

> $a_{rad} = a_n = \frac{v^2}{R}$
$v = \frac{2\pi R}{T}$
$a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

> the total acceleration is:
$a = \sqrt{a_{rad}^2 + a_{tan}^2}$

> **Nonuniform Circular Motion**
In nonuniform circular motion there is also a component of acceleration that is parallel to the instantaneous velocity. Here we call this component $a_{tan}$  

## **Summary**
If a particle has a perpendicular *Acceleration* it will have a curve trajectory, although it has an acceleration the velocity could keep equal.

An Uniform Circular Motion is when a particle moves along a circle with constant velocity. It has an acceleration though, but this acceleration is Perpendicular to the velocity changing its *direction* but not its *magnitude*

This acceleration named **Radial acceleration $\vec{a}_{rad}$** or **Normal Acceleration $\vec{a}_n$** and can be calculated by: $a_{rad} = \frac{v^2}{R}$
 Also can be obtained with: $a_{rad} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$

A **Nonuniform Circular Motion** is a type of circular motion where the velocity of the particle is diminishing or augmenting. In this case, there is an Acceleration parallel to the velocity vector. This acceleration is named *Tangential Acceleration* and is denoted as $a_{tan}$.
