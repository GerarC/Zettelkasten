# SZPs03G Relative Velocity

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 3.5.

## **Quote**
> Relative velocity: When a body P moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $B$, and $B$ moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $A$, we denote the velocity of $P$ relative to $B$ by $\vec{v}_{P/B}$, the velocity of $P$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{P/A}$, and the velocity of $B$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{B/A}$. If these velocities are all along the same line, their components along that line are related by Eq. (3.32). More generally, these velocities are related by Eq.

> $v_{P/A-x} = v_{P/B-x} + v_{B/A-x}$
(relative velocity along a line)

> $\vec{v}_{P/A} = \vec{v}_{P/B} + \vec{v}_{B/A}$
(relative velocity in space)

## **Summary**
Relative Velocity:
- a body P moves relative a body A -> $\vec{v}_{P/A}$ (P of Plane and A of air in this case).
- the body A moves relative to an Observer O(other body) -> $\vec{v}_{A/O}$.
- if the velocities $\vec{v}_{P/O}$ and $\vec{v}_{P/A}$ are in the along the same line, their components on that line are related by $v_{P/O-x} = v_{P/A-x} + v_{A/O-x}$
- the general equation is $\vec{v}_{P/O} = \vec{v}_{P/A} + \vec{v}_{B/O}$
