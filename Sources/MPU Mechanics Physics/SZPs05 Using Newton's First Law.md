## **Summary**
Applying The First Newton Law:
- Using the I SEE strategy
- Identify: How it's a problem of equilibrium you have to use the first law equation even if the body moves (at a steady speed) and if there are more various bodies interacting, then use equations from the third law and finally identify target variables.
- Set up: Draw a sketch of the situation with all the implicated bodies, then make a free-body diagram for each body (a particle), label each force, don't draw the forces exerted by the body, and choose the coordinate axes and define the positive direction of the axes.
- Execute: find the components of each vector, remember that the magnitude of a vector always is positive but the components may not be. Set the sum of the all components equal to zero (equilibrium), repeat the previous things for each body and make sure you have as many independent equations as unknown quantities. then solve it.
- Evaluate: look your results and see if they make sense. If is a symbolic expression check if it works with any special cases you know previously.
