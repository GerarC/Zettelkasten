> The work–energy theorem, Eq. (6.6), says that the total work done on the body equals the change in the body’s kinetic energy: $W_{tot} = \Delta K = K_2 - K_1$. If gravity is the only force that acts, then from Eq. (7.3), $W_{tot} = W_{grav} = - \Delta U_{grav} = U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2}$.

> $\Delta K = -\Delta U_{grav}$
Rewrited:
$K_1 + U_{grav,\space 1} = K_2 + U_{grav,\space 2}$

> The sum of $K + U_{grav}$ is called E, the total mechanical energy of the system. By “system” we mean the body of mass m and the earth considered together

> The sum of $K + U_{grav}$ is called E, the total mechanical energy of the system. By “system” we mean the body of mass m and the earth considered together

> Then $E_1 = K_1 + U_{grav,\space 1}$ is the total mechanical energy at $y_1$ and $E_2 = K_2 + U_{grav,\space 2}$ is the total mechanical energy at $y_2$.
$E_1 = E_2$. That is, $E$ is constant

> then:
$E = K + U_{grav} = \text{\large cte}$.

> #### When Forces other than Gravity Do Work
$W_{other} + W_{grav} = K_2 - K_1$ 
$W_{other} + U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2} = K_2 - K_1$

> #### Situations With Both Gravitational And Elastic Potential Energy
If $W_{tot} = W_{grav} + W_{el} + W_{other}$. The work-energy theorem then give $W_{tot} = W_{grav} + W_{el} + W_{other} = K_2 - K_1$
In General: $K_1 + U_1 + W_{other} = K_2 + U_2$

> #### The Law Of Conservation Of Energy
Nonconservative forces cannot be represented in terms of potential energy. But we can describe the effects of these forces in terms of kinds of energy other than kinetic or potential energy. 
> 
The energy associated with this change in the state of the materials is called internal energy. 

## **Summary**
Mechanical Energy:
- through Work and Kinetic energy and the potential energy we know that $\Delta K = -\Delta U_{grav}$
- $K_1 + U_{grav,\space 1} = K_2 + U_{grav,\space 2}$
- $E = K + U_{grav} = \text{\large cte}$.
- As $E$ is a constant, so in general $K_1 + U_1 + W_{other} = K_2 + U_2$
- Even if Nonconservative forces cannot be represented using potential energies, their effects can be described using other types of energies such as kinetic.
