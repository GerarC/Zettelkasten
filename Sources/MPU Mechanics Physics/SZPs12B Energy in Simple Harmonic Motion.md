# SZPs12B Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 14.3.

## **Quote**
> The total mechanical energy E is also directly related to the amplitude A of the motion. When the body reaches the point $x = A$, its maximum displacement from equilibrium, it momentarily stops as it turns back toward the equilibrium position. That is, when $x = A$ (or $-A$), $v_x = 0$.$ At this point the energy is entirely potential, and $E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Because E is constant, it is equal to $\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ at any other  point.

$E = \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$
$E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2\sin^2(\omega t + \phi) + \frac{1}{2}kA^2\cos^2(\omega t + \phi) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$

## **Summary**
<!-- try to apply the method of the question and the answer, if there is more than one idea, then make a single note or sub note from each idea -->
