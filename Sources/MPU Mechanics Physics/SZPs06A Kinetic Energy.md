> #### The Meaning of Kinetic Energy
Gives insight into the physical meaning of kinetic energy. The hammerhead is dropped from rest, and its kinetic energy when it hits the I-beam equals the total work done on it up to that point by the net force. This result is true in general: To accelerate a particle of mass m from rest (zero kinetic energy) up to a speed v, the total work done on it must equal the change in kinetic energy from zero to $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$:
$W_{tot} = K - 0 = K$

> So the kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the total work that was done to accelerate it from rest to its present speed (Fig. 6.13). The definition $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, wasn’t chosen at random; it’s the only definition that agrees with this interpretation of kinetic energy.

> This gives us another interpretation of kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the total work that particle can do in the process of being brought to rest. 
 
> #### Work and Kinetic Energy in Composite Systems
the total kinetic energy of such a system can 
change even when no work is done on any part of the system by anything outside it.

## **Summary**
Kinetic Energy:
- Is the work that was done to accelerate a particle from rest to its present speed.
- $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- kinetic energy can change even when no work is done by anything outside the system.
- As we can see, has the same units of the Work. And this comes from the Work-Energy Theorem.
