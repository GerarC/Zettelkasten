# SZPs10D Rolling Without Slipping

We view the motion in an inertial frame of reference in 
which the surface on which the wheel rolls is at rest. In this frame, the point on the wheel that contacts the surface must be instantaneously at rest so that it does not slip.

> Hence the velocity $\vec{v}_1'$ of the point of contact relative to the center of mass must have the same magnitude but opposite direction as the center-of-mass velocity $\vec{v}_{cm}$. If the wheelâ€™s radius is $R$ and its angular speed about the center of mass is $\omega$, then the magnitude of $\vec{v}_1'$ is $R\omega$; hence $v_{cm} = R\omega$.

## **Summary**
Rolling Without Slipping:
- It's an important case of combined translation and rotation.
- As the circle is not slipping, by sum of forces, the point that is touching the surface is at rest.
- For a wheel with a radius $R$ and Angular velocity $\omega$, the velocity of its center of mass is $v_{cm} = R\omega$.
