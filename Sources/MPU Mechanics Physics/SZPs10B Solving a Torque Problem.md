## **Summary**
Solving torque problem:
- Just as always, Use the I SEE scheme.
- Identify if the target is a force, a torque, an acceleration, etc and know that use the torque-acceleration is the best way to resolve it.
- Set up, sketching, draw free-body diagrams, and choose coordinate system.
- Execute, using the sum of the forces and the sum of the torques, expressing in algebraic form the relationships between the bodies and Ensuring that there are as many independent equations as there are unknowns.
- Evaluate, By checking the all make sense, since the algebraic expressions to the values and the Units.
