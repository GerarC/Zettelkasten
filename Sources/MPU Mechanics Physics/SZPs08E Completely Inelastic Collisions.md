# SZPs08E Completely Inelastic Collisions

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 8.3.

## **Quote**
> Because the two bodies stick together after the collision, they have the same final velocity $\vec{v}_2$:
$\vec{v}_{A2} = \vec{v}_{B2} = \vec{v}_{2}$

> Conservation of momentum gives the relationship
$m_A\vec{v}_{A1} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1} = (m_A + m_B)\vec{v}_{2}$

> If B is initially at rest
$v_{2x} = \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}v_{A1x}$

> The ratio of final to initial kinetic energy is
$\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}$

## **Summary**
Completely Inelastic Collisions:
- Are collisions where the acting bodies stick together after the collision.
- As they are sticked they have the same final velocity $\vec{v}_2$.
- Conservation of momentum gives: $m_A\vec{v}_{A1} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1} = (m_A + m_B)\vec{v}_{2}$
- if B is initially at rest: $v_{2x} = \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}v_{A1x}$
- The ratio of final and initial kinetic energy is $\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}$.
