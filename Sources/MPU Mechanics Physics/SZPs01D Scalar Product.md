# SZPs01D Scalar Product

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 1.10.

## **Quote**
> We denote the scalar product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ by $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$. Because of this notation, the scalar product is also called the dot product. Although $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are vectors, the quantity $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$ is a scalar.  

> $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = AB\cos\phi = \vec{A}\vec{B}\cos\phi$
or
$\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = A_xB_x + A_y+B_y + A_zB_z$
