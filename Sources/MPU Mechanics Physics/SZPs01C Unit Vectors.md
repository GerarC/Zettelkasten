# SZPs01C Unit Vectors

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 1.9.

## **Quote**
> A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1, with no units. Its only purpose is to point—that is, to describe a direction in space. Unit vectors provide a convenient notation for many expressions involving components of vectors. We will always include a caret, or “hat” (^), in the symbol for a unit vector to distinguish it from ordinary vectors whose magnitude may or may not be equal to 1.

> In an xy-coordinate system we can define a unit vector $\hat{i}$ that points in the direction of the positive x-axis and a unit vector $\hat{j}$ that points in the direction of the positive y-axis.

> $\vec{A} = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j}$

## **Summary**
Unit vector is a *Vector* that has *Magnitude* 1 and *Direction* in only one axis, commonly is represented by a lower case letter with a hat. In two dimension unit of x and y are $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ respectively and you can obtain any vector multiplying scalars and adding between them.
