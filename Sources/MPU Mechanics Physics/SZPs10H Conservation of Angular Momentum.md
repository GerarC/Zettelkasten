# SZPs10H Conservation of Angular Momentum

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 10.6.

## **Quote**
> We have just seen that angular momentum can be used for an alternative university Physics, Sears  statement of the basic dynamic principle for rotational motion. It also forms the basis for the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Like conservation of energy and of linear momentum, this principle is a universal conservation law, valid at all scales from atomic and nuclear systems to the motions of galaxies
When the net external torque acting on a system is zero, the total angular momentum of the system is constant (conserved).
if $\sum\vec{\tau}=\Large\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = 0$ so $\vec{L}$ is constant.

## **Summary**
Conservation of Angular Momentum:
- When there's not External Torques acting on the system $(\sum \tau_z = 0)$ the Angular momentum is conserved.
- Is used to calculate changes of $\omega_z$.
