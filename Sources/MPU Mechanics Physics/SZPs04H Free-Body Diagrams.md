> Newton’s three laws of motion contain all the basic principles we need to solve a wide variety of problems in mechanics. These laws are very simple in form, but the process of applying them to specific situations can pose real challenges. In this brief section we’ll point out three key ideas and techniques to use in any problems involving Newton’s laws. You’ll learn others in Chapter 5, which also extends the use of Newton’s laws to cover more complex situations.
>  1. Newton’s first and second laws apply to a specific body. Whenever you use Newton’s first law, $\sum\vec{F}=0$, for an equilibrium situation or Newton’s second law, $\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$, for a non-equilibrium situation, you must decide at the beginning to which body you are referring. This decision may sound trivial, but it isn’t.
>  2. Only forces acting on the body matter. The sum $\sum\vec{F}$ includes all the forces that act on the body in question. Hence, once you’ve chosen the body to analyze, you have to identify all the forces acting on it. Don’t confuse the forces acting on a body with the forces exerted by that body on some other body. For example, to analyze a person walking, you would include in $\sum\vec{F}$ the force that the ground exerts on the person as he walks, but not the force that the person exerts on the ground (Fig. 4.28). These forces form an action–reaction pair and are related by Newton’s third law, but only the member of the pair that acts on the body you’re working with goes into $\sum\vec{F}$.
>  3. Free-body diagrams are essential to help identify the relevant forces. A free-body diagram shows the chosen body by itself, “free” of its surroundings, with vectors drawn to show the magnitudes and directions of all the forces that act on the body. We’ve already shown free-body diagrams in Figs. 4.17, 4.18, 4.20, and 4.25a. Be careful to include all the forces acting on the body, but be equally careful not to include any forces that the body exerts on any other body. In particular, the two forces in an action–reaction pair must never appear in the same free-body diagram because they never act on the same body. Furthermore, never include forces that a body exerts on itself, since these can’t affect the body’s motion.

> When a problem involves more than one body, you have to take the problem apart and draw a separate free-body diagram for each body.

## **Summary**
Free-Body Diagrams:
- Think which body you are referring-
- only the forces acting on the body matter.
- try to don't confuse the forces exerted by the body and the forces acting on it.
- This type of diagrams are essential to identify the relevant forces and resolve the exercises.
