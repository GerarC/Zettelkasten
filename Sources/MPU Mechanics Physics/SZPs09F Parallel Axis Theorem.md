# SZPs09F Parallel Axis Theorem

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 9.5.

## **Quote**
> A body doesnâ€™t have just one moment of inertia. In fact, it has infinitely many, because there are infinitely many axes about which it might rotate. But there is a simple relationship, called the parallel-axis theorem, between the moment of inertia of a body about an axis through its center of mass and the moment of inertia about any other axis parallel to the original axis
$I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2$

## **Summary**
Parallel Axis theorem:
- A body has infinite moments of inertia.
- There is a simple relationship between the $I$ about an axis through its center of mass and any other parallel to it.
- This relation is: $I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2$.
