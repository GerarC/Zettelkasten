# SZPs04C Newton's First Law

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.2.

## **Quote**
> **Newton's First Law of Motion:** A body acted on by no net force has a constant velocity (which may be zero) and zero acceleration.

> It’s important to note that the net force is what matters in Newton’s first law.

> When a body is either at rest or moving with constant velocity (in a straight line with constant speed), we say that the body is in equilibrium. For a body to be in equilibrium, it must be acted on by no forces, or by several forces such that their vector sum—that is, the net force—is zero:
$\sum\vec{F}=0$

## **Summary**
First Law:
- A body with no Net force has a constant velocity and no acceleration.
- the particular forces don't matter, only the net.
- When a body has no net force is in equilibrium.
- $\sum\vec{F}=0$
