# SZPs00C Using and Converting Units

## **Quote** 
> An equation must always be dimensionally consistent. You canâ€™t add apples  and automobiles; two terms may be added or equated only if they have the same  units. For example, if a body moving with constant speed v travels a distance d in a time t, these quantities are related by the equation *Page 31*

> Always use units in calculations Make it a habit to always write  numbers with the correct units and carry the units through the calculation as in the  example above. This provides a very useful check. If at some stage in a calculation  you find that an equation or an expression  has inconsistent units, you know you have  made an error. *Page 31*

## **Summary**
In an equation must always be a consistency of dimensions, i.e., a side must have the same dimension of the other side. It need to be with the same units to ensure that the dimensions are being respect.

It's a good habit to always write the units of the numbers your are working with.

To keep all the problem in the same units sometimes you need to convert a unit to other as long as they are in the same dimension of measuring. When you have to do it, then you can use the **I SEE** method. Identify the units, set up and execute the solutions, it means set and do the multiplications or divisions you need and evaluate if your conversion is correct.
