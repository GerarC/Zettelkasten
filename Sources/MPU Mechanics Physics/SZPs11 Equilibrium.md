> ### 11.1 Conditions of Equilibrium
For an extended body, the equivalent statement is that the center of mass of the body has zero acceleration if the vector sum of all external forces acting on the body is zero, as discussed in Section 8.5. This is often called the first condition for equilibrium:
$\sum\vec{F} = 0$

A rigid body in equilibrium can’t have any tendency to start 
rotating about any point, so the sum of external torques must be zero about any 
point. This is the second condition for equilibrium:
$\sum\vec{\tau} = 0$

> ### 11.3 Solving Equilibrium Problems
There are just two key conditions for rigid-body equilibrium: The vector sum of the forces on the body must be zero, and the sum of the torques about any point must be zero. To keep things simple, we’ll restrict our attention to situations in which we can treat all forces as acting in a single plane, which we’ll call the xy-plane. Then we need consider only the x- and y-components of force in Eq. (11.1), and in Eq. (11.2) we need consider only the z-components of torque

## **Summary**
Conditions of Equilibrium:
- For an extended body, there are two conditions that must be fulfilled.
- The first condition is that the sum of external Forces must be zero.
- $\sum\vec{F} = 0$.
- The second condition is that the sum of external Torques is zero too.
- $\sum\vec{\tau} = 0$.

Solving Equilibrium Problems:
- As always, Use the I SEE method.
- Identify all the relevant concepts.
- Set up the problem, its variables and draw the FreeBody Diagrams.
- Execute the solution solving the equations.
- Evaluate if your answer is correct.
