# SZPs04G Newton's Third Law

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.5.

## **Quote**
> Newton's Third Law of Motion: If body A exerts a force on body B (an “action”), then body B exerts a force on body A (a “reaction”). These two forces have the same magnitude but are opposite in direction. These two forces act on different bodies.
$\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$
It doesn’t matter whether one body is inanimate

## **Summary**
Third Law:
- Always when a body A exerts a force in other body B, the body B exerts a force with the same magnitude but with opposite direction to the body A
- $\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$
- it doesn't matter one body is inanimate.
