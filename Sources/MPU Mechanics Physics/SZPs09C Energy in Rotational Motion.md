> A rotating rigid body consists of mass in motion, so it has kinetic energy. As we will see, we can express this kinetic energy in terms of the body’s angular speed and a new quantity

> Different particles have different values of ri, but v is the same for all (otherwise, the body wouldn’t be rigid). The kinetic energy of the ith particle can be expressed as
$\frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_ir_i^2\omega^2$
$K = \frac{1}{2}m_2r_2^2\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2r_2^2\omega^2 + ... + \frac{1}{2}m_nr_n^2\omega^2 = \sum^n \frac{1}{2}m_ir_i^2\omega^2$
$K = \frac{1}{2}(m_2r_2^2 + m_2r_2^2 + ... + m_nr_n^2)\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\sum^n m_ir_i^2)\omega^2$

> The quantity in parentheses, obtained by multiplying the mass of each particle by the square of its distance from the axis of rotation and adding these products, is called the moment of inertia I of the body for this rotation axis: $I = \sum^n m_ir_i^2$

> “Moment” means that I depends on how the body’s mass is distributed in space; it has nothing to do with a “moment” of time. For a body with a given rotation axis and a given total mass, the greater the distances from the axis to the particles that make up the body, the greater the moment of inertia $I$. In a rigid body, all distances $r_i$ are constant and $I$ is independent of how the body rotates around the given axis. The SI unit of I is the kilogram-meter<sup>2</sup> $(kg \cdot m^2)$.

> $K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$
Equation gives a simple physical interpretation of moment of inertia: *The greater the moment of inertia, the greater the kinetic energy of a rigid body rotating with a given angular speed v*.

## **Summary**
Moment of Inertia:
- It's the product between the mass, the distance of this mass to the rotation axis and the velocity.
- $I = \sum^nm_ir_i^2$.
- The word moment in this context means that $I$ depends on how the mass is distributed in space.
- The SI unit is $kg\cdot m^2$.

Energy in Rotation:
- A rotating body is mass in motion, Then it can be expressed in terms of angular speed and the moment of inertia.
- As inertia represent the movement of all particles in the rotating body, then the energy of the body is: $K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$.
- This equation gives a physical interpretation of moment of inertia: the greater $I$, the greater $K$.
