# SZPs08D Collisions

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 8.3.

## **Quote**
> If the forces between the colliding bodies are much larger than any external forces, as is the case in most collisions, we can ignore the external forces and treat the bodies as an isolated system. Then momentum is conserved and the total momentum of the system has the same value before and after the collision.

> #### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions
If the forces between the bodies are also conservative, so no mechanical energy is lost or gained in the collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is the same after the collision as before. Such a collision is called an elastic collision. 
> 
A collision in which the total kinetic energy after the collision is less than before the collision is called an inelastic collision.
> 
An inelastic collision in which the colliding bodies stick together and move as one body after the collision is called a completely inelastic collision.

> #### Classifying Collisions
Itâ€™s important to remember that we can classify collisions according to energy considerations. A collision in which kinetic energy is conserved is called elastic.

Finally, we emphasize again that we can sometimes use momentum conservation even when external forces are acting on the system, if the net external force acting on the colliding bodies is small in comparison with the internal forces during the collision.

## **Summary**
Collisions:
- A collision is an interaction between two or more bodies.
- If the forces between the colliding bodies are larger than any external force, then we can ignore the external ones.
- there are two types of collisions: Elastic and inelastic.

Elastic Collisions:
- If the forces between the bodies are conservative, so no mechanical energy is lost or gained, the collision is named elastic collision.
- The kinetic energy is conserved.
