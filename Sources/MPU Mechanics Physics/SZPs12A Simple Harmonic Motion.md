# SZPs12A Simple Harmonic Motion

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 14.2.

## **Quote**
> The simplest kind of oscillation occurs when the restoring force Fx is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium x. This happens if the spring in Figs. 14.1 and 14.2 is an ideal one that obeys Hookeâ€™s law (see Section 6.3). The constant of proportionality between $F_x$ and x is the force constant k. On either side of the equilibrium position, $F_x$ and x always have opposite signs.
$F_x = -kx$

> When the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, as given by Eq. (14.3), the oscillation is called simple harmonic motion (SHM). The acceleration
$a_x = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{m}x$
The minus sign means that, in SHM, the acceleration and displacement always have opposite signs. This acceleration is not constant.

#### Circular Motion and the Equations of SHM 
![[MPS Circular Motion as SHM.png]]
That is, simple harmonic motion is the projection of uniform circular motion onto a diameter.

The x-component of the phasor at time t is just the x-coordinate of the point Q:
$x = A \cos\theta$

we get that the acceleration of point P is:
$a_x = -w^2x$

provided that the angular speed v of the reference point Q is related to the force constant k and mass m of the oscillating body by
$w^2=\frac{k}{m}$

Frequency
$f=\large\frac{w}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$

So, Period
$T = 2\pi\large\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$


#### Period and Amplitude is SHM
Equations (14.11) and (14.12) show that the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion are completely determined by the mass m and the force constant k. In simple harmonic motion the period and frequency do not depend on the amplitude A. For given values of m and k, the time of one complete oscillation is the same whether the amplitude is large or small. 

#### Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration in SHM
$x = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$
$v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = -\omega A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$
$a_x = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\omega^2A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$
$\phi = \arctan\large(-\frac{v_{0x}}{\omega x_0})$
$A = \sqrt{x^2_0 + \Large\frac{v_{0x}^2}{\omega^2}}$
