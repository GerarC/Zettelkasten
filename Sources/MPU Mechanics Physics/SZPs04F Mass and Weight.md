# SZPs04F Mass and Weight

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.4.

## **Quote**
> Mass characterizes the inertial properties of a body. Mass is what keeps the china on the table when you yank the tablecloth out from under it. The greater the mass, the greater the force needed to cause a given acceleration; this is reflected in Newtonâ€™s second law, $\sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$.
Weight, on the other hand, is a force exerted on a body by the pull of the earth. Mass and weight are related: Bodies that have large mass also have large weight. A large stone is hard to throw because of its large mass, and hard to lift off the ground because of its large weight.
$\vec{w}=m\vec{g}$

## **Summary**
Weight:
- weight is not the same as mass.
- mass is an inertial quantity.
- weight is the force that acts on the body by the pull of the planet.
- $\vec{w}=m\vec{g}$
