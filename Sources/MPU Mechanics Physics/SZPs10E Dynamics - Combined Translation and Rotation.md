# SZPs10E Dynamics - Combined Translation and Rotation

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 10.3.

## **Quote**
> We can also analyze the combined translational and rotational motions of a rigid body from the standpoint of dynamics. We showed in Section 8.5 that for an extended body, the acceleration of the center of mass is the same as that of a particle of the same mass acted on by all the external forces on the actual body.
The rotational motion about the center of mass is described by the rotational analog of Newton’s second law:
$\sum\tau_z=I_{cm}\alpha_z$

> It’s not immediately obvious that Eq. (10.13) should apply to the motion of a translating rigid body; after all, our derivation of $\sum \tau_z = I\alpha_z$ in Section 10.2 assumed that the axis of rotation was stationary. But Eq. (10.13) is valid even when the axis of rotation moves, provided the following two conditions are met:
>  1. The axis through the center of mass must be an axis of symmetry.
>  2. The axis must not change direction.

## **Summary**
Dynamics of Combined Translation and Rotation:
- Is possibly to analyze a body that is translating and rotating at the same time using $\sum\tau_z=I_{cm}\alpha_z$ and $\sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a}_{cm}$.
- This works even if the rotation axis changes, but only if this axis through the center of the mass
