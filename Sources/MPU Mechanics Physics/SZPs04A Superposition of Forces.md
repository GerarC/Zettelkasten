> **Superposition of Forces**
When you throw a ball, at least two forces act on it: the push of your hand and the downward pull of gravity. Experiment shows that when two forces $\vec{F}_1$ and $\vec{F}_2$ act at the same time at the same point on a body, the effect on the bodyâ€™s motion is the same as if a single force $\vec{R}$ were acting equal to the vector sum, or resultant, of the original forces: $\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2$. More generally, any number of forces applied at a point on a body have the same effect as a single force equal to the vector sum of the forces. This important principle is called superposition of forces.

## **Summary**
Superposition of Forces:
- Basically all the forces act as only one
- this unique force is called Net Force
- the Net force is the sum of all the forces acting over the body
- $\vec{F}_{net} = \sum\vec{F}$
