# SZPs02C Motion With Constant Acceleration

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 2.4.

## **Quote**
> The simplest kind of accelerated motion is straight-line motion with constant acceleration. In this case the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the motion. As an example, a falling body has a constant acceleration if the effects of the air are not important.

> $a_x = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$
$v_x = v_{0x} + a_xt$
$x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$
$t = \frac{v_x - v_{0x}}{a_x}$
$v_x^2 = v_{0x}^2 + 2a_x(\Delta x)$
$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_{0x} + v_x)t$

## **Summary**
The **Motion With Constant Acceleration** is the most basic kind of motion where the *acceleration* acts. In this type on movement the *velocity* change at the same rate.

To solve problems of this type of motion you have to use the *I SEE*: Identify relevant things and what equations you could use, Set Up the problem, i.e., Read the problem, make a diagram, choose where you place the coordinates origin, identify and list what you have and what you want, and try to predict an answer; then *Execute* the solution, It means that you have to do the algebra; finally *Evaluate* the answer you obtain and see if you like it or not.
