# SZPs07A Gravitational Potential Energy

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 7.1.

## **Quote**
> In many situations it seems as though energy has been stored in a system, to be recovered later.
 
> For this reason, energy associated with position is called potential energy. The potential energy associated with a bodyâ€™s weight and its height above the ground is called gravitational potential energy.
 
> The other way is to say that the kinetic energy increases as the gravitational potential energy decreases.
 
> $W_{grav} = Fs = w(y_1 - y_2) = mgy_1 - mgy_2$
 
> In that case the quantity $(y_1 - y_2)$ is negative, and 
> $W_{grav}$ is negative because the weight and displacement are opposite in direction.
 
> $U_{grav} = mgy$ where $U$ is the letter with we symbolized Potential Energy.
 
> $W_{grav} = U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2} = -\Delta U_{grav}$

> The negative sign in front of $\Delta U_{grav}$ is essential. When the body moves up, y increases, the work done by the gravitational force is negative, and the gravitational potential energy increases $(\Delta U_{grav} < 0)$. When the body moves down, y decreases, the gravitational force does positive work, and the gravitational potential energy decreases $(\Delta U_{grav} > 0)$. 

## **Summary**
Potential Energy:
- Sometimes it seems as though energy is saved in a system to be recovered later.
- The energy that can be associated with a position is called potential energy.
- The most known potential energies are the gravitational and the elastic.

Gravitational Potential Energy:
- The potential energy associated with a body weight and its height above a referential point is the gravitational potential energy.
- The kinetic energy increases as the grav potential decreases.
- The Work done by the gravity also can be expressed as the negative change of gravitational potential energy.
- $W_{grav} = U_{grav,\space 1} - U_{grav,\space 2} = -\Delta U_{grav}$
- It must be negative because is an inverse relation.
