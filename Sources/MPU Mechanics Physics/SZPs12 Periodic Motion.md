# SZPs12 Periodic Motion

## **Quote**
> Many kinds of motion repeat themselves over and over: the vibration of  a quartz crystal in a watch, the swinging pendulum of a grandfather clock, the sound vibrations produced by a clarinet or an organ pipe, and the back-and-forth motion of the pistons in a car engine. This kind of motion, called periodic motion or oscillation.

> It’s simplest to define our coordinate system so that the origin O is at the equilibrium position, where the spring is neither stretched nor compressed. Then x is the x-component of the displacement of the body from equilibrium and is also the change in the length of the spring. The spring exerts a force on the body with x-component $F_x$.

> When the body is at O, the net force acting on it is zero (Fig. 14.2b), but because of its motion it overshoots the equilibrium position. On the other side of the equilibrium position the body is still moving to the left, but the net force and the acceleration are to the right (Fig. 14.2c); hence the speed decreases until the body comes to a stop. We will show later that with an ideal spring, the stopping point is at x = -A. The body then accelerates to the right, overshoots equilibrium again, and stops at the starting point x = A, ready to repeat the whole process. The body is oscillating! If there is no friction or other force to remove mechanical energy from the system, this motion repeats forever; the restoring force perpetually draws the body back toward the equilibrium position, only to have the body overshoot time after time.

> #### Amplitude, Period Frequency, and Angular Frequency
The amplitude of the motion, denoted by A, is the maximum magnitude of displacement from equilibrium—that is, the maximum value of 0 x0 . It is always positive. If the spring in Fig. 14.2 is an ideal one, the total overall range of the motion is 2A. The SI unit of A is the meter. A complete vibration, or cycle, is one complete round trip—say, from A to -A and back to A.
> 
The period, $T$, is the time to complete one cycle. It is always positive. The SI unit is the second, but it is sometimes expressed as “seconds per cycle.”
> 
The frequency, $f$, is the number of cycles in a unit of time. It is always positive. The SI unit of frequency is the hertz, named for the 19th-century German physicist Heinrich Hertz:
$1\space hertz = 1\space Hz = 1\space cycle/s = 1\space s^{-1}$
> 
The angular frequency, $\omega$, is $2\pi$ times the frequency:
$\omega=2\pi f$
$\omega$ is a useful quantity. It represents the rate of change of an angular quantity (not necessarily related to a rotational motion) that is always measured in radians, so its units are $rad/s$.
> 
By definition, period and frequency are reciproclas of each other:
$f=\large\frac{1}{T}$ $T=\large\frac{1}{f}$
Also, from the definition of $\omega$.
$\omega=2\pi f=\large\frac{2\pi}{T}$
