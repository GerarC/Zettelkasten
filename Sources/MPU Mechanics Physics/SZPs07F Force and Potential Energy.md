# SZPs07F Force and Potential Energy

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 7.4.

## **Quote**
$F_x(x)\Delta x = -\Delta U$ and $F_x(x) = - \Large{\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x}}$

$F_x(x) = - \Large{\frac{dU(x)}{dx}}$

## **Summary**
Force and Potential Energy:
- $W_x = F_x\Delta x$ 
- $F_x(x)\Delta x = -\Delta U$ and $F_x(x) = - \Large{\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x}}$
- $F_x(x) = - \Large{\frac{dU(x)}{dx}}$
- A force can be calculated as the rate of change of potential energy in the displacement.
