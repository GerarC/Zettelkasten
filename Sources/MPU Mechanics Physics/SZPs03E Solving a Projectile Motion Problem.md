## **Summary**
Like with a simple motion with constant Acceleration, you can use the *I SEE* method to solve a problem of *Projectile Motion*.

*Identify* the relevant concepts of the motion, in this case is that the gravity is constantly accelerating the body downward and has a magnitude of g. these equations just are valid when the body is only affected by the gravity. *Set up* define the coordinate system and make a diagram/sketch, list the known and unknown quantities and which are the target, **State the problem in words maybe questions and translate this words to symbols**. *Execute* the solution finding the target variables through the equation you chose. And *Evaluate* the answer you obtain, whether you like what you see or not.
