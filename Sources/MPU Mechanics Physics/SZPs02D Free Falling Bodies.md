# SZPs02D Free Falling Bodies

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 2.5.

## **Quote**
The most familiar example of motion with (nearly) constant acceleration is a body falling under the influence of the earth’s gravitational attraction. Such motion has held the attention of philosophers and scientists since ancient times. In the fourth century b.c., Aristotle thought (erroneously) that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies, in proportion to their weight. Nineteen centuries later, Galileo (see Section 1.1) argued that a body should fall with a downward acceleration that is constant and independent of its weight.

The constant acceleration of a freely falling body is called the acceleration due to gravity, and we denote its magnitude with the letter g. We will frequently use the approximate value of g at or near the earth’s surface:
$g = 9.80m/s^2$

## **Summary**
One of the most common examples of *Motion with Constant Acceleration* is the Motion of Free Falling Bodies, There the acceleration is the gravity and already has a specific value.

$g = 9.80m/s^2$
