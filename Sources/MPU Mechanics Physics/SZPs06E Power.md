# SZPs06E Power

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 6.4.

## **Quote**
> The definition of work makes no reference to the passage of time. If you lift a barbell weighing 100 N through a vertical distance of 1.0 m at constant velocity, you do 1100 N211.0 m2 = 100 J of work whether it takes you 1 second, 1 hour, or 1 year to do it.

> Power is the time rate at which work is done. Like work and energy, 
power is a scalar quantity.
$P_{av} = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$
$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$

> The SI unit of power is the watt (W), named for the English inventor James Watt. One watt equals 1 joule per second: $1 W = 1 J/s$

> Also can be seen as:
$P = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}$

## **Summary**
Power:
- As the definition of the work doesn't refer to the time.
- The Work is always the same whether it takes one second, one hour and so on.
- Power is time at the work is done and is also a Scalar.
- By definition, the power is: $P = \frac{dW}{dt}$.
- Power SI unit is the watt (W), $1 W = 1 J/s$.
- Also can be seen as $P = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}$.
