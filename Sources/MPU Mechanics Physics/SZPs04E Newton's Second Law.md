# SZPs04E Newton's Second Law

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.3.

## **Quote**
> **Stating Newtonâ€™s Second Law**
Newton's Second Law of Motion: If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. The mass of the body times the acceleration vector of the body equals the net force vector.

> In symbols,
$\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$

>[!Note]
The force is also defined as the change of momentum in a time.
$\large\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$

## **Summary**
Second Law:
- If one or more external forces act on a body and the net force is not zero, then the body accelerates.
- the direction of the acceleration is the same as the net force.
- the magnitude of this acceleration depends on its inertial mass.
- A particular case of it is $\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$.
- The real version is $\large\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$ being $\vec{P}$ the Momentum
