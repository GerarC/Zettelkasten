# SZPs01A Components of Vectors

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 1.8.

## **Quote**
$\frac{Ax}{A} = \cos\theta$ and $\frac{Ay}{A} = \sin\theta$
 
$Ax = A \cos\theta$ and $Ay = A \sin\theta$

## **Summary**
You calculate a *Component of a Vector* when you project the vector on an axis, for example, you can find the components x and y of a vector in a two dimension system. you also can obtain the direction of the vector with the components.

In this case, to find the components you can use the next equations:
$\large Ax = A \cos\theta$ and $\large Ay = A \sin\theta$

And to find the direction you just need resort to the next equation:

$\theta = \arctan{\frac{A_y}{A_x}}$
