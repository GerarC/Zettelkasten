# SZPs03 Position Vector

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 3.1.

## **Quote**
Let’s see how to describe a particle’s motion in space. If the particle is at a point P  at a certain instant, the position vector $\vec{r}$ of the particle at this instant is a vector that goes from the origin of the coordinate system to point P (Fig. 3.1 on next page). The Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z of point P are the x-, y-, and z-components of Vector $\vec{r}$

$\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$

## **Summary**
The position of a particle can be describe by a *Vector* denoted as $\vec{r}$.

In two dimensions is $\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j}$
