# SZPs07E Nonconservative Forces

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 7.3.

## **Quote**
> Not all forces are conservative. Consider the friction force.

> The lost kinetic energy canâ€™t be recovered by reversing the motion or in any other way, and mechanical energy is not conserved. So there is no potential-energy function for the friction force.

> A force that is not conservative is called a nonconservative force. The work done by a nonconservative force cannot be represented by a potential-energy function. Some nonconservative forces, like kinetic friction or fluid resistance, cause mechanical energy to be lost or dissipated; a force of this kind is called a dissipative force. There are also nonconservative forces that increase mechanical energy. 


## **Summary**
Nonconservative Force:
- Not all the forces are conservative.
- The lost of kinetic energy can't be recovered.
- Mechanical Energy is not conserved.
- So there is not potential energy to represent these forces.
- Some energies of this types are also called dissipative energy.
- But there are also nonconservative energies that increase mechanical energy.
