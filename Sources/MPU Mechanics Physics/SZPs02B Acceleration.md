# SZPs02B Acceleration

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 2.3.

## **Quote**
Just as velocity describes the rate of change of position with time, acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity with time. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector quantity. 

$a_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

**Instantaneous Acceleration**
$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}$

## **Summary**
Like *Velocity* is the change of the position in time, the *Acceleration* is the change of the Velocity in the time.

to obtain the average velocity in a interval, use:
$a_{avg-x} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{2x} - v_{1x}}{t_2 - t_2}$

To calculate the instantaneous acceleration of a position, use the next equation:
$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}$
