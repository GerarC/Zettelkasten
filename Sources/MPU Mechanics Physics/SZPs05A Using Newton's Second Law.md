## **Summary**
Resolving Second Law Exercises:
- Use I SEE Strategy.
- Identify: you have to use the second law equation, also you could have to use the third law and identify the target variable
- Draw a simple sketch and the free-body diagrams, label all the forces, choose the coordinate axes and their positive directions and think which other equation you need that is not the second law eq. And express any relation as equation relating the accelerations of the various bodies.
- Execute: determine components, sum all the components on an axis and equal it to the mass and the acceleration. and finally do the math.
- Evaluate: verify the units, algebraic signs, consider particular values or extreme cases and compare the results with the intuitive expectations.
