that act between members of the system. This means that we can apply conservation of momentum even if (as is often the case) we know very little about the internal forces. We have used Newtonâ€™s second law to derive this principle, so we have to be careful to use it only in inertial frames of reference.


## **Summary**
Conservation of Momentum:
- When two or more bodies are interacting, without external forces
- The rates of the change of the momenta of the particles system is 0.
- $\vec{F}_{B\space on\space A} = \Large\frac{d\vec{p}_A}{dt}$  $\vec{F}_{A\space on\space B} = \Large\frac{d\vec{p}_B}{dt}$
- $\vec{F}_{B\space on\space A} + \vec{F}_{A\space on\space B} = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt} = 0$
- As the change of momentum is zero then: $\vec{P} = \vec{p}_A + \vec{p}_B$
