# SZPs10F Work and Power In Rotational Motion

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 10.4.

## **Quote**
> When you pedal a bicycle, you apply forces to a rotating body and do work on it. Similar things happen in many other real-life situations, such as a rotating motor shaft driving a power tool or a car engine propelling the vehicle. 
$dW = F_{tan}Rd\theta$
$W = \int^{\theta_2}_{\theta_1}\tau_zd\theta$
If the torque is constant $W = \tau(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = \tau_z\Delta\theta$
When a torque does work on a rotating rigid body, the kinetic energy changes by an amount equal to the work done. We can prove this by using exactly the same procedure that we used in Eqs. (6.11) through (6.13) for the translational kinetic energy of a particle.

> How does power relate to torque? When we divide both sides of Eq. (10.19) by the time interval dt during which the angular displacement occurs, we find
$P = \tau_z\omega_z$


## **Summary**
Rotational Work:
- Just as an lineal displacement done by a force, When a torque rotate an object there's Work.
- $W = \int^{\theta_2}_{\theta_1}\tau_zd\theta$
- If torque is constant, so $W = \tau(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = \tau_z\Delta\theta$.
- It's also valid the Kinetic and Work theorem.

Rotational Power:
- Power is the change of of work in time, then $P = \large\tau_z\omega_z$.
