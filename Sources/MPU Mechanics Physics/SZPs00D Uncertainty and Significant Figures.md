# SZPs00D Uncertainty and Significant Figures

## **Reference** 
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 1.5, Page 31.

## **Quote** 
> The distinction between the measurements with a ruler and with a caliper is in their **uncertainty**; the measurement with a caliper has a smaller uncertainty. The uncertainty is also called the **error** because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value. The uncertainty or error of a measured value depends on the measurement technique used. *Page 33*

> In many cases the uncertainty of a number is not stated explicitly. Instead, the uncertainty is indicated by the number of meaningful digits, or **significant  figures**, in the measured value. We gave the thickness of the cover of the book as 2.91 mm, which has three significant figures. By this we mean that the first two digits are known to  be correct, while the third digit is uncertain. *Page 33*

> When you use numbers that have uncertainties to compute other numbers, the  computed numbers are also uncertain. When numbers are multiplied or divided,  the result can have no more significant figures than the factor with the fewest significant figures has. For example, 3.1416 * 2.34 * 0.58 = 4.3. When we add and subtract numbers, itâ€™s the location of the decimal point that matters, not the number of significant figures. For example, 123.62 + 8.9 = 132.5. *Page 33*

## **Summary**
The *Uncertainty* or *Error* of an measure refers to the difference between the real and the measured values, It depends on the measurement method, Other way to allude to Error is talking about the Significant Figures, When you say a value has $n$ significant figures, $n-1$ are well known and the last one is uncertain.
