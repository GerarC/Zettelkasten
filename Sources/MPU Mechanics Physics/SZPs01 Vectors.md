## **Quote**
> Some physical quantities, such as time, temperature, mass, and density, can be described completely by a single number with a unit. But many other important quantities in physics have a direction associated with them and cannot be described by a single number.

> When a physical quantity is described by a single number, we call it a scalar quantity. In contrast, a vector quantity has both a magnitude (the “how much” or “how big” part) and a direction in space.

> We usually represent a vector quantity such as displacement by a single letter, such as $\vec{A}$

> We usually represent the magnitude of a vector quantity by the same letter used for the vector, but in lightface italic type with no arrow on top.

## **Summary**
A *Vector* is a *Magnitude*, i.e., how much there is of some, that also has a *Direction*. A vector is often represented as a letter with an arrow over it, like $\vec{A}$. The magnitude value is represented using only the letter and the direction is given by an angle.
