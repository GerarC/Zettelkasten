# SZPs09 Angular Velocity and Acceleration

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 9.1.

## **Quote**
> Instead, we notice that the line OP is fixed in the body and rotates with it. The angle $\theta$ that OP makes with the +x-axis is a single angular coordinate that completely describes the body’s rotational position.
> 
The angular coordinate $\theta$ of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis can be positive or negative. If we choose positive angles to be measured counterclock-wise from the positive x-axis

$\theta = \Large\frac{s}{r}$ or $s = r\theta$
> 
$1\space\text{rad} =$ $\Large\frac{360°}{2\pi}$ $= 57.3°$

> #### Angular Velocity
$\omega_z = \Large\frac{d\theta}{dt}$
Is the ratio of change of the $\theta$ angle.
The subscript z indicates that the body is rotating about the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the plane of the diagram.
> 
If angle $\theta$ is in radians, the unit of angular velocity is the radian per second (rad/s). Other units, such as the revolution per minute (rev/min or rpm).
> 
$1\space\text{rev/s} = 2\pi\space\text{rad/s}$ and $1\space\text{rev/min} = 1 \space\text{rpm} = \frac{2\pi}{60}\text{rad/s}$
the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation.

> #### Angular Acceleration
$\Large\alpha_z = \frac{d\omega_z}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$
> 
The usual unit of angular acceleration is the radian per second per second, or $rad/s^2$


## **Summary**
Radian:
- A radian is an Angle used to measure circular-type movement that is more natural because it's the ratio between the displacement and the Radius of the circle.
- $\theta = \Large\frac{s}{r}$ or $s = r\theta$
- a radian is equivalent to $57.3\degree$

Angular Velocity:
- This quantity is the ratio of change of $\theta$ in the time.
- If the angle is measured in Radians then the angular velocity radian per second (rad/s).
- Symbolized with $\omega$.
- $1\space\text{rev/s} = 2\pi\space\text{rad/s}$
- The vector of the angular acceleration is perpendicular to the plane of rotation. Symbolizing that the body is rotating around this axis.
- This axis is denoted by a $z$

Angular acceleration:
- Just as Linear velocity has an acceleration, The Angular Velocity has one too.
- Symbolized with $\alpha$.
- This acceleration is the ratio of change of angular velocity.
- This vector also is in the z axis.
- The most common Unit of Angular Acceleration is the $rad/s^2$.
