# SZPs10C Combined Translation and Rotation

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 10.3.

## **Quote**
> We can extend our analysis of the dynamics of rotational motion to some cases in which the axis of rotation moves. When that happens, the motion of the body is combined translation and rotation. Every possible motion of a rigid body can be represented as a combination of translational motion of the center of mass and rotation about an 
axis through the center of mass. This is true even when the center of mass accelerates, so it is not at rest in any inertial frame.

> #### Combined Translation and Rotation Energy Relationships
For such a body, K is the sum of two parts:
$K = \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2$

## **Summary**
Translation and Rotation:
- A body can translate its center of the mass and rotate about it.
- Both movement can be expressed independently even are happening at the same time.

Energy of Translation and rotation:
- The energy of a body with the two types of movement can be calculated by: $K = \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2$.
