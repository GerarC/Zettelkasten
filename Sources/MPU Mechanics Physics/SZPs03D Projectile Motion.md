# SZPs03D Projectile Motion

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 3.3.

## **Quote**
> A projectile is any body that is given an initial velocity and then follows a path determined entirely by the effects of gravitational acceleration and air resistance. A batted baseball, a thrown football, and a bullet shot from a rifle are all projectiles. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory

## **Summary**
Projectile motion describe the movement of these body that are thrown and moves horizontally and vertically then combine two types of motion in the same body, one with constant *Velocity* and other accelerated by the gravity.
