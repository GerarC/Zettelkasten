## **Quote**
> When two billiard balls collide, they squash a little near the surface of contact, but then they spring back. Some of the kinetic energy is stored temporarily as elastic potential energy, but at the end it is reconverted to kinetic energy.

> Letâ€™s look at a one-dimensional elastic collision between two bodies A and B.
From conservation of kinetic energy we have:
$\frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A1x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B1x}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A2x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}^2$
and conservation of momentum gives:
$m_A\vec{v}_{A1x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1x} = m_A\vec{v}_{A2x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}$

> #### Elastic Collisions, One Body Initially at Rest
The general solution to the above equations is a little complicated, so we will concentrate on the particular case in which body B is at rest before the collision (so vB1x = 0).
$\frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A1x}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A2x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}^2$
$m_A\vec{v}_{A1x} = m_A\vec{v}_{A2x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}$
> 
With this we obtain
$v_{B2x} = v_{A1x} + v_{A2x}$
> 
$v_{A2x} = \frac{m_A - m_B}{m_A + m_B}v_{A1x}$
$v_{B2x} = \frac{2m_A}{m_A + m_B}$

## **Summary**
Elastic collision:
- The general equations are:
	- $\frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A1x}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_A\vec{v}_{A2x}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}^2$
	- $m_A\vec{v}_{A1x} = m_A\vec{v}_{A2x} + m_B\vec{v}_{B2x}$
- But are a little bit difficult, then in a lot of problems a body is initially at rest
- With this we obtain:
	- $v_{B2x} = v_{A1x} + v_{A2x}$
	- $v_{A2x} = \frac{m_A - m_B}{m_A + m_B}v_{A1x}$
	- $v_{B2x} = \frac{2m_A}{m_A + m_B}$
