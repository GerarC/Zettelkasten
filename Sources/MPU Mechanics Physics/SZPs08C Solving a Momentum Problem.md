## **Summary**
Solving a Momentum problem:
- Using the I SEE pattern.
- Identify if there is no external forces acting on.
- Set up the problem: Each body is a particle, draw before and after, and label each particle and their quantities, known and unknown. Define the coordinate system and identify the target variables.
- Execute the solution writing an expression equating the initial and the final momenta, in some problems, the energy equations are very useful. And finally solve the equations.
- Evaluate if your answer make sense.
