> The physicist’s definition of work is based on these observations. Consider a body that undergoes a displacement of magnitude s along a straight line. (For now, we’ll assume that any body we discuss can be treated as a particle so that we can ignore any rotation or changes in shape of the body.) While the body moves, a constant force $\vec{F}$ acts on it in the same direction as the displacement $\vec{s}$. We define the work W done by this constant force under these circumstances as the product of the force magnitude $F$ and the displacement magnitude $s$:
> $W = Fs$

> The SI unit of work is the joule (abbreviated J, pronounced “jool,” and named in honor of the 19th-century English physicist James Prescott Joule). From Eq. (6.1) we see that in any system of units, the unit of work is the unit of force multiplied by the unit of distance. In SI units the unit of force is the newton and the unit of distance is the meter, so 1 joule is equivalent to $1\space\text{newton-meter}$ ($N \cdot m$): $1\space joule = (1\space newton)(1\space meter) \quad or \quad 1 J = 1\ N \cdot m$

> But what if the person pushes at an angle f to the car’s displacement? Then $\vec{F}$ has a component $F_\parallel = F\cos\phi$ in the direction of the displacement $\vec{s}$ and a component $F_\perp = F\sin\phi$ that acts perpendicular to $\vec{s}$.

> Only the parallel component $F_\parallel$ is effective in moving the car, so we define the work as the product of this force component and the magnitude of the displacement. Hence $W = F_\parallel s = (F\cos\phi)s$
$W = Fs\cos\phi$

> has the form of the scalar product of two vectors: $W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{s}$

> #### Work: positive, negative, or Zero
When the force has a component in the same direction as the displacement ($\phi$ between $0°$ and $90°$), $\cos\phi$ in Eq. Is positive and the work W is *positive*. When the force has a component opposite to the displacement ($\phi$ between $90°$ and $180°$), $\cos\phi$ is negative and the work is *negative*. When the force is perpendicular to the displacement, $\phi = 90°$ and the work done by the force is *zero*.

> #### Total Work
How do we calculate work when several forces act on a body? One way is to use (6.2) or (6.3) to compute the work done by each separate force. Then, because work is a scalar quantity, the total work Wtot done on the body by all the forces is the algebraic sum of the quantities of work done by the individual forces. An alternative way to find the total work Wtot is to compute the vector sum of the  forces (that is, the net force) and then use this vector sum.

> The work done by the force in the total displacement 
from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is approximately
$W = F_{ax} \Delta x_a + F_{bx} \Delta x_b + ...$

> In the limit that the number of segments becomes very large and the width of each becomes very small, this sum becomes the integral: $W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_xdx$

## **Summary**
Work:
- It's defined as the scalar product of a force and a displacement.
- $W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{s}$, where s is the displacement vector.
- The work is positive if the force has a component parallel to the movement.
- If one component is opposite to the movement then the work is negative.
- If all the components of the force are perpendicular to the movement, then the work is *zero*.
- The total work is the sum of the works made by all the forces.
- The work in general is $W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}F_xdx$, But if the Force is Constant, can be pulled of the integral.

Joule:
- the Work SI is the Joule or J, a Joule is a Newton per Meter $1J=1N\cdot m$.
