# SZPs10A Torque and Angular Acceleration

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 10.2.

## **Quote**
> The angular acceleration of a rotating rigid body is directly proportional to the sum of the torque components along the axis of rotation. The proportionality factor is the moment of inertia.
$\sum\tau_z = I\alpha_z$

> Just as Newtonâ€™s second law says that a net force on a particle causes an acceleration in the direction of the net force, Eq. (10.7) says that a net torque on a rigid body about an axis causes an angular acceleration about that axis.

## **Summary**
Torque and Angular Acceleration:
- Just as Force and Acceleration and the massin the second law, Torque has a relationship with the Angular Acceleration and the moment of inertia.
- $\sum\tau_z = I\alpha_z$
