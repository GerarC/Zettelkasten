# SZPs09E Gravitational Potential for a Extended Body

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 9.4.

## **Quote**
> If the acceleration of gravity $g$ is the same at all points on the body, the gravitational potential energy is the same as though all the mass were concentrated at the center of mass of the body. Suppose we take the y-axis vertically upward. Then for a body with total mass $M$, the gravitational potential energy $U$ is simply

## **Summary**
Gravitational potential for extended body:
- Works in the same way, but using the center of mass.
