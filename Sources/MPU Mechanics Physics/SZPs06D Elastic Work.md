# SZPs06D Elastic Work

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 6.3.

## **Quote**
> the force we apply to the right-hand end has an x-component directly proportional to x:
$F_x = kx$ (force required to stretch a spring) 
where $k$ is a constant called the force constant (or spring constant) of the spring. The units of k are force divided by distance: $N/m$ in SI units.

> The observation that force is directly proportional to elongation for elongations that are not too great was made by Robert Hooke in 1678 and is known as Hooke’s law. It really shouldn’t be called a “law,” since it’s a statement about a specific device and not a fundamental law of nature. 

> The force at the moving end does do work. Figure 6.19 is a graph of $F_x$ as a function of x, the elongation of the spring. The work done by this force when the elongation goes from zero to a maximum value X is
$W = \int^X_0F_x\space dx = \int^X_0 kx\space dx = \frac{1}{2}kX^2$
$W=\frac{1}{2}(X)(kX)=\frac{1}{2}kX^2$
$W = \frac{1}{2}kx_2^2-\frac{1}{2}kx_1^2$

## **Summary**
Elastic Work:
- The force you have to apply to a spring to stretch it is $F_x = kx$.
- $k$ represents the spring constant.
- The Units of $K$ are force divided by distance in SI units.
- This only works for small elongations and is known as the Hooke's "law", it's not a law though, is a statement about a specific device.
- The Work done by a force when goes from 0 to a maximum $X$ is: $W=\frac{1}{2}kX^2$.
- And the work done from a $x$ to another is: $W = \frac{1}{2}kx_2^2-\frac{1}{2}kx_1^2$.
