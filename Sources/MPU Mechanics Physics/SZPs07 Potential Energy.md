# **SZPs07 Potential Energy**
## **Reference**


## **Quote**
> In physics, **potential energy** is the energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.

> Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, whose total work is path independent, are called conservative forces. 

## **Summary**
Potential Energy:
- Is the energy Held by a body because its position is relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge and others.
- Is associated with the work done by conservative forces.
