# SZPs09G Moment Of Inertia Calculations

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 9.6.

## **Quote**
> If a rigid body is a continuous distribution of mass it cannot be represented by a few point masses. In this case the sum of masses and distances that defines the moment of inertia becomes an *integral*.
Then the moment of inertia is
$I = \int r^2\space dm$

> To evaluate the integral, we have to represent r and dm in terms of the same integration variable. When the object is effectively one-dimensional, such as the slender rods 

> For a three-dimensional object it is usually easiest to express $dm$ in terms of an element of volume $dV$ and the density r of the body. Density is mass per unit volume, $\rho = dm/dV$
$I = \int r^2\rho\space dV$

> If the body is uniform in density, then we may take $\rho$ outside the integral:
$I = \rho\int r^2\space dV$

## **Summary**
Calculation of Moment of Inertia:
- If the body is continuous, the its moment of inertia is an integral
- $I = \int r^2\space dm$.
- But if the body is three-dimensional then is easiest to express $dm$ in term of volume: $I = \int r^2\rho\space dV$.
- Where $\rho$ is the density of the body: $\rho = dm/dV$.
- If the body has a uniform density, then $\rho$ can get out of the integral.
