# SZPs04 Force

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 4.1.

## **Quote**
> a force is a push or a pull. A better definition is that a force is an interaction between two bodies or between a body and its environment. That’s why we always refer to the force that one body exerts on a second body.

> To describe a force vector $\vec{F}$, we need to describe the direction in which it acts as well as its magnitude, the quantity that describes “how much” or “how hard” the force pushes or pulls. The SI unit of the magnitude of force is the newton, abbreviated N.

## **Summary**
Force:
- is a push or pull.
- The interaction between two bodies or a body with the environment.
- denoted by $\vec{F}$
- its SI unit is the Newton
