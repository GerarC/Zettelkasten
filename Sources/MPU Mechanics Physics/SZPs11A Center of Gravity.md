# SZPs11A Center of Gravity

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 11.2.

## **Quote**
> In most equilibrium problems, one of the forces acting on the body is its weight. We need to be able to calculate the torque of this force. The weight doesn’t act at a single point; it is distributed over the entire body. But we can always calculate the torque due to the body’s weight by assuming that the entire force of gravity (weight) is concentrated at a point called the center of gravity (abbreviated “cg”).

> First let’s review the definition of the center of mass.
Now consider the gravitational torque on a body of arbitrary shape.
Every particle in the body experiences a gravitational force, and the total weight of the body is the vector sum of a large number of parallel forces. A typical particle has mass $m_i$ and weight $\vec{w}_i = m_i\vec{g}$. If $\vec{r}_i$ is the position vector of this particle with respect to an arbitrary origin O, then the torque vector
$\vec{\tau} = \vec{r}_{cm}\times M\vec{g}$


## **Summary**
Center of Gravity:
- The gravity act in all the points of the body, but can be concentrated at a point called Center of Gravity, abbreviated by $cg$.
- Basically the center of gravity is the torque done by the gravity at the Center of Mass i.e., $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r}_{cm}\times M\vec{g}$. If the gravity is not homogeneous, Cg can be different from the Center of the Mass, but in general can be take as the same point.
