# SZPs05B Friction Forces

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 5.3.

## **Quote**
> Friction is important in many aspects of everyday life. The oil in a car engine minimizes friction between moving parts, but without friction between the tires and the road we couldn’t drive or turn the car.

> **Kinetic and static Friction**
First, when a body rests or slides on a surface, we can think of the surface as exerting a single contact force on the body, with force components perpendicular and parallel to the surface (Fig. 5.17). The perpendicular component vector is the normal force, denoted by $\vec{n}$. The component vector parallel to the surface (and perpendicular to $\vec{n}$) is the friction force, denoted by $\vec{f}$. If the surface is frictionless, then $\vec{f}$ is zero but there is still a normal force.

> The kind of friction that acts when a body slides over a surface is called a **kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$**. The adjective “kinetic” and the subscript “$k$” remind us that the two surfaces are moving relative to each other. The magnitude of the kinetic friction force usually increases when the normal force increases. This is why it takes more force to slide a full box of books across the floor than an empty one.
In many cases the magnitude of the kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$ is found experimentally to be approximately proportional to the magnitude n of the normal force:
$$f_k = \mu_kn$$

> > [!warning] CAUTION
>Friction and normal forces are always perpendicular Remember that Eq. (5.3) is not a vector equation because $\vec{f}_k$ and $\vec{n}$ are always perpendicular. Rather, it is a scalar relationship between the magnitudes of the two forces.

> Friction forces may also act when there is no relative motion. If you try to slide a box across the floor, the box may not move at all because the floor exerts an equal and opposite friction force on the box. This is called a **static friction force $\vec{f}_s$**.

$f_s \le (f_S)_{max} = \mu_sn$

## **Summary**
Friction:
- Is the force of the contact between the surface and the body.
- its parallel to the surface.
- perpendicular and proportional to the magnitude of the normal force (it increases when the normal force increase).
- denoted by $\vec{f}$

Kinetic Friction:
- It's the friction that acts when a body moves over a surface
- denoted by $\vec{f}_k$
- its magnitude is found with $f_k = \mu_kn$

Static Friction:
- This type of friction acts when there is no motion. Blocking the body and not letting it move.
- it also depends on the net force (the more it push or pull, the more friction there is).
- it has a maximum value given by $(f_s)_{max}$.
- the magnitude of the static friction goes from 0 to its maximum value: $f_s \le (f_S)_{max} = \mu_sn$.
- when the net force pass the max value, the object begins to move.
