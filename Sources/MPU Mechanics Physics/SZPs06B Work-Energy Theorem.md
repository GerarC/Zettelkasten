# SZPs06B Work-Energy Theorem

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 6.2.

## **Quote**
> In Eq. (6.4) the product Fs is the work done by the net force F and thus is equal to the total work $W_{tot}$ done by all the forces acting on the particle. The quantity $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is called the kinetic energy K of the particle:
$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
Where K is the Kinetic Energy.

> We can now interpret Eq. (6.4) in terms of work and kinetic energy. The first term on the right side of Eq. (6.4) is $K_2=\frac{1}{2}mv^2_2$, the final kinetic energy of the particle (that is, after the displacement). The second term is the initial kinetic energy, $K_1=\frac{1}{2}mv^2_1$, and the difference between these terms is the change in kinetic energy. So:
$W_{tot} = K_2 - K_2 = \Delta K$

> From Eq. (6.4) or Eq. (6.6), kinetic energy and work must have the same units. Hence the joule is the SI unit of both work and kinetic energy (and, as we will see later, of all kinds of energy). To verify this, note that in SI the quantity $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$

> Because we used Newton’s laws in deriving the work–energy theorem, we can use this theorem only in an inertial frame of reference. Note that the work–energy theorem is valid in any inertial frame, but the values of Wtot and $K_2 - K_1$ may  differ from one inertial frame to another (because the displacement and speed of a  body may be different in different frames).

## **Summary**
Work-Energy Theorem:
- Basically this theorem says that the total work made on a body is equal to its change of kinetic energy.
- As equation is $W_{tot} = K_2 - K_1 = \Delta K$.
- This theorem only works in an inertial frame of reference.
