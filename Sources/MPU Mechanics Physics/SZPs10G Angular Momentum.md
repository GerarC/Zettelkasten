# SZPs10G Angular Momentum

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 10.5.

## **Quote**
> Every rotational quantity that we have encountered in Chapters 9 and 10 is the analog of some quantity in the translational motion of a particle. The analog of momentum of a particle is angular momentum, a vector quantity denoted as $\vec{L}$. Its relationship to momentum $\vec{p}$ (which we will often call linear momentum for clarity) is exactly the same as the relationship of torque to force, $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$. For  particle with constant mass m and velocity v, the angular momentum is
$\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p}=\vec{r}\times m\vec{v}$

> he right-hand rule for vector products shows that its direction is 
along the +z@axis, and its magnitude is
$L = mvr\sin\phi = mvl$

> The rate of change of angular momentum of a particle equals the torque of the net force acting on it. 
$\sum\vec{\tau}=\Large\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}$

> #### Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body
The angular velocity vector V also lies along the rotation axis, as we saw in Section 9.1. Hence for a rigid body rotating around an axis of symmetry, L and V are in the same direction (Fig. 10.26). So we have the vector relationship
$\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}$


## **Summary**
Angular Momentum:
- is the analog of the momentum for rotational motion.
- $\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p}=\vec{r}\times m\vec{v}$.
- $\vec{L}$ is the quantity of rotation.
- Like the Torque can be calculated as the product of a tangential force and its distance to the rotation axis, $\vec{L}$ is the product of the velocity and its orthogonal distance to the center.
- $L = mvr\sin\phi = mvl$.
- Just as Force and Momentum, the Change of the Angular momentum in time is the net torque.
- $\sum\vec{\tau}=\Large\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}$
- Is also valid that $\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}$.
