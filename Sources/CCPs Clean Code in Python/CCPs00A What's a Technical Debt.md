## **Quote** 
> what problems are we creating for ourselves in the future?

> The word debt is a good choice. It's a debt because the code will be harder to change in the future than it would be to change it now.

> Technical debt refers to the concept of problems in the software as a result of a compromise, and a bad decision being made. In a way, it's possible to think about technical debt in two ways. From the present to the past. What if the problems we are currently facing are the result of previously written bad code? From the present to the futureâ€”if we decide to take the shortcut now, instead of investing time in a proper solution, what problems are we creating for ourselves in the future?

> It is not something that raises a high alarm. Instead, it is a silent problem, scattered across all parts of the project, that one day, at one particular time, will wake up and become a show-stopper

## **Summary**
A technical debt is something that will be so difficult change in the future and should be changed immediately.

The most of the time it's a bad decision being made.

The most dangerous is that a debt is a silent problem that in any moment raises and could stop all the project.
