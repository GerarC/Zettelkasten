# CCPs00C why documentation is important

## **Reference**
Clean code in python, Mariano Anaya; Chapter 1, Page 47.


## **Quote** 
> One important distinction; documenting the code is not the same as adding comments on it. Comments are bad, and they should be avoided. By documentation, we refer to the fact of explaining the data types, providing examples of them, and annotating the variables.

> Having comments in the code is a bad practice for multiple reasons. First, comments represent our failure to express our ideas in the code. If we actually have to explain why or how we are doing something, then that code is probably not good enough.

## **Summary**
In any programming language it's very important a good documentation, but it's even more important in python because it is dynamically typed.

Documentation was useful to show what's the type of the variables, but now in python there are annotations, they do exactly it. However, now we can use the documentation to explain other things like the structure of a iterable if we use it, and what does the function or method.

Have comments is very bad because it means that the code is confuse and not explain nothing for itself.
