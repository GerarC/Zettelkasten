# CPPs02E Container Objects

## **Reference** 
Clean code in python, Mario Anaya; Chapter 2, Pages \[106, 107\].

## **Quote** 
Containers are objects that implement a `__contains__` method (that usually returns a Boolean value). This method is called in the presence of the `in` keyword of Python. *Page 106*

What if the map itself (called grid on the code) could answer this question? Even better, what if the map could delegate this action to an even smaller (and hence more cohesive) object? *Page 107*
