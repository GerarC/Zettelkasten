# CCPs00B Why coding style

## **Reference** 
Clean code in python, Mario Anaya; Chapter 1, Pages 41 to 42.

## **Quote** 
> A coding guideline is a bare minimum a project should have to be considered being developed under quality standards.

> If all members of the development team agree on a standardized way of structuring the code, the resulting code would look much more familiar.

> When the code is structured randomly, without following any logic, or adhering to any standard, then it would be as difficult for us to spot mistakes as a novice developer. On the other hand, if we are used to reading code in a structured fashion, and we have learned to quickly get the ideas from the code by following patterns, then we are at a considerable advantage.

## **Summary**
A whole project should have a standardized style of coding.

Like the chess players, if the project has not a defined structure, find patterns, problems, and so on, it's so hard.

So it's easier to all member understand the code of each others.

If you want to care your coding style in python can use tools like mypy, pylint, black and etc.
