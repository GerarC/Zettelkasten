# CCPs00D Why Documentation

## **Reference**
[Why documentation is important in software development](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-documentation-important-software-development-alexander-ryan/)
## **Quote**
> Documenting your code is beneficial for many reasons. Documentation makes the code easier to maintain and update; if you document why you chose certain approaches, future developers will understand your work much better because they'll know where to make changes when updates are needed. Documentation may also help you learn from your mistakes now, so you don't repeat them when you're working on the next project. Finally, documentation saves time; it takes less time to create documentation than it does to write instructions for other people in another language because that person doesn't need the information as a developer does.

## **Summary**

The documentation is useful to maintain and update the code, other developers will understand easily your code, and you will learn from your errors and you wont repeat them in the future. And finally documentation saves time 'cause you don't need to explain your code later.
