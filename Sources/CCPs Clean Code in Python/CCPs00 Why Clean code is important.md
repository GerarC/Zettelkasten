# CCPs00 Why Clean code is important

## **Reference** 
Clean code in python, Mario Anaya; Chapter 1, Page 35.

## **Quotes**
> For decades of using the terms programming languages, we thought that they were languages to communicate our ideas to the machine, so it can run our programs. We were wrong.

> Here is where the true nature of clean code lies. It depends on other engineers to be able to read and maintain the code. Therefore, we, as professionals, are the only ones who can judge this. Think about it; as developers, we spend much more time reading code than actually writing it. Every time we want to make a change or add a new feature, we first have to read all the surroundings of the code we have to modify or extend.



## **Summary**
The people that program usually think that the languages are used to communicate with the computer, but it's not the whole truth.

It's very important know that a very vital point of the programming languages is that they are mainly made to communicate programmer with each other.

It's very important also to the programmer himself 'cause after a time, If he has to return an App development could be hard understand his code.

And finally find and resolve a technical debt will be easier
