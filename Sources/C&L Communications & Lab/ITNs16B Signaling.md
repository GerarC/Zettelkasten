# ITNs16B Signaling

## **Reference**
<!-- Where do you got it -->

## **Quote**
The physical layer must generate the electrical, optical, or wireless signals that represent the "1" and "0" on the media. The way that bits are represented is called the signaling method. The physical layer standards must define what type of signal represents a "1" and what type of signal represents a "0". This can be as simple as a change in the level of an electrical signal or optical pulse. For example, a long pulse might represent a 1 whereas a short pulse might represent a 0.

This is similar to the signaling method used in Morse code, which may use a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks to send text over telephone wires or between ships at sea.


## **Summary**
<!-- try to apply the method of the question and the answer, if there is more than one idea, then make a single note or sub note from each idea -->
