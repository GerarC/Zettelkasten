# ITNs09B Configure IP Addressing

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.7.

## **Quote**
> End devices typically default to using DHCP for automatic IPv4 address configuration. DHCP is a technology that is used in almost every network. The best way to understand why DHCP is so popular is by considering all the extra work that would have to take place without it.

> In a network, DHCP enables automatic IPv4 address configuration for every end device that is DHCP-enabled. Imagine the amount of time it would take if every time you connected to the network, you had to manually enter the IPv4 address, the subnet mask, the default gateway, and the DNS server. Multiply that by every user and every device in an organization and you see the problem. Manual configuration also increases the chance of misconfiguration by duplicating another deviceâ€™s IPv4 address.

## **Summary**

Manually configuration of the End Device Address:
- Each type of End device has a way to configure manually the IP address will use.
- Increases the chance of misconfiguration.
- I will not explain it because it's not typically use it.

Automatic IP Addressing Configuration:
- End devices typically default to using DHCP for automatic IPv4 configuration.
- DHCP is a technology used in almost all networks.
- DCHP enable automatic IPv4 address configuration.
- Choose the IP Address, the subnet mask and the DNS server.
