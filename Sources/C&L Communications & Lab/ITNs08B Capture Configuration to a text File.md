# ITNs08B Capture Configuration to a text File

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.5.

## **Quote**
> Configuration files can also be saved and archived to a text document. This sequence of steps ensures that a working copy of the configuration file is available for editing or reuse later.

> The text file created can be used as a record of how the device is currently implemented. The file could require editing before being used to restore a saved configuration to a device.

> To restore a configuration file to a device:
**Step 1.** Enter global configuration mode on the device.
**Step 2.** Copy and paste the text file into the terminal window connected to the switch.

## **Summary**

Save Configuration files:
- to save configuration file, you can use `show running-config` and copy the text in a computer file.

Restore the *configuration* from a file:
- Enter to the *global configuration mode*.
- Copy and paste configuration you saved in the text file.
