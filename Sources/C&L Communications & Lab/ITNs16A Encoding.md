# ITNs16A Encoding

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 4.1.

## **Quote**
Encoding or line encoding is a method of converting a stream of data bits into a predefined "code‚Äù. Codes are groupings of bits used to provide a predictable pattern that can be recognized by both the sender and the receiver. In other words, encoding is the method or pattern used to represent digital information. This is similar to how Morse code encodes a message using a series of dots and dashes.

For example, Manchester encoding represents a 0 bit by a high to low voltage transition, and a 1 bit is represented as a low to high voltage transition.

## **Summary**
Encoding:
- Encoding is the used method or pattern to represent data streams to send it through media as lows and highs.
- An good example can be the morse code that have dots and dashes to represent letters.
