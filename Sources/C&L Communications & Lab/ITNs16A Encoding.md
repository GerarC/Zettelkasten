# ITNs16A Encoding

## **Reference**
<!-- Where do you got it -->

## **Quote**
Encoding or line encoding is a method of converting a stream of data bits into a predefined "code‚Äù. Codes are groupings of bits used to provide a predictable pattern that can be recognized by both the sender and the receiver. In other words, encoding is the method or pattern used to represent digital information. This is similar to how Morse code encodes a message using a series of dots and dashes.

For example, Manchester encoding represents a 0 bit by a high to low voltage transition, and a 1 bit is represented as a low to high voltage transition.

## **Summary**
<!-- try to apply the method of the question and the answer, if there is more than one idea, then make a single note or sub note from each idea -->
