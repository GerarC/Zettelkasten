## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 3.7.

## **Quote**
> The network and data link layers are responsible for delivering the data from the source device to the destination device. protocols at both layers contain a source and destination address, but their addresses have different purposes:
> -   **Network layer source and destination addresses** - Responsible for delivering the IP packet from the original source to the final destination, which may be on the same network or a remote network.
> -   **Data link layer source and destination addresses** - Responsible for delivering the data link frame from one network interface card (NIC) to another NIC on the same network.

## **Summary**
<!-- try to apply the method of the question and the answer, if there is more than one idea, then make a single note or sub note from each idea -->
