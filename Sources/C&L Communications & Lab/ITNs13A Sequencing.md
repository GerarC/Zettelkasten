# ITNs13A Sequencing

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 3.6.

## **Quote**
> The challenge to using segmentation and multiplexing to transmit messages across a network is the level of complexity that is added to the process. Imagine if you had to send a 100-page letter, but each envelope could only hold one page. Therefore, 100 envelopes would be required and each envelope would need to be addressed individually. It is possible that the 100-page letter in 100 different envelopes arrives out-of-order.

> In network communications, each segment of the message must go through a similar process to ensure that it gets to the correct destination and can be reassembled into the content of the original message, as shown in the figure. TCP is responsible for sequencing the individual segments.

## **Summary**
Sequencing:
- Using Segmentation is to add other level of complexity to sending messages and is possible that the fragments reach the destination out of the order.
-  Sequencing is a process which ensure that data gets to the correct destination and can be rea
