> **WANs**
The figure shows a WAN which interconnects two LANs. A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

> WANs have specific characteristics:
> -   WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
> -   WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
> -   WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.

## **Summary**
A *Wide Area Network* or **WAN** is a Network infrastructure that interconnects devices through a huge geographical area and is typically administered by corporations, telecommunications service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs). A WAN interconnects *LANS* over wide areas from cities to continents, is often managed by multiple SPs and provides slower speed links between LANS.
