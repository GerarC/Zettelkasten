# ITNs23A Data Link Layer Standards

## **Reference**
<!-- Where do you got it -->

## **Quote**
> Data link layer protocols are generally not defined by Request for Comments (RFCs), unlike the protocols of the upper layers of the TCP/IP suite. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) maintains the functional protocols and services for the TCP/IP protocol suite in the upper layers, but they do not define the functions and operation of the TCP/IP network access layer.
> 
> Engineering organizations that define open standards and protocols that apply to the network access layer (i.e., the OSI physical and data link layers) include the following:
> -   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
> -   International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
> -   International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
> -   American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

## **Summary**
