# ITNs19 Fiber-Optic Cabling

> ## Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling
> As you have learned, fiber-optic cabling is the other type of cabling used in networks. Because it is expensive, it is not as commonly used at the various types of copper cabling. But fiber-optic cabling has certain properties that make it the best option in certain situations, which you will discover in this topic.
> 
> Optical fiber cable transmits data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than any other networking media. Unlike copper wires, fiber-optic cable can transmit signals with less attenuation and is completely immune to EMI and RFI. Optical fiber is commonly used to interconnect network devices.
> 
> Optical fiber is a flexible, but extremely thin, transparent strand of very pure glass, not much bigger than a human hair. Bits are encoded on the fiber as light impulses. The fiber-optic cable acts as a waveguide, or “light pipe,” to transmit light between the two ends with minimal loss of signal.

> ## Types of Fiber Media
> Fiber-optic cables are broadly classified into two types:
> 
> -   Single-mode fiber (SMF)
> -   Multimode fiber (MMF)
> 
> 
> **Single-Mode Fiber**
> 
> SMF consists of a very small core and uses expensive laser technology to send a single ray of light, as shown in the figure. SMF is popular in long-distance situations spanning hundreds of kilometers, such as those required in long haul telephony and cable TV applications.

> A cross-section of a single-mode fiber optic cable consisting of a center glass core of 9 microns in diameter, surrounded by a glass cladding of 125 microns in diameter, surrounded by a polymeric coating. An x-ray vision sideview shows that this type of cable construction produces a single straight path for the light.
> 
> **Multimode Fiber**
> 
> MMF consists of a larger core and uses LED emitters to send light pulses. Specifically, light from an LED enters the multimode fiber at different angles, as shown in the figure. MMFs are popular in LANs because they can be powered by low-cost LEDs. It provides bandwidth up to 10 Gbps over link lengths of up to 550 meters.
> 
> One of the highlighted differences between MMF and SMF is the amount of dispersion. Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time. Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength. MMF has a greater dispersion than SMF. That is why MMF can only travel up to 500 meters before signal loss.

## **Summary**
Fiber-Optic Cabling:
- It's expensive, it's not as commonly used as the copper cabling.
- Transmit the data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than other types of media.
- Is completely immune to EMI and RFI signals and has a low attenuation.
- There are two types of Fiber: Single-mode fiber (SMF) and Multimode fiber (MMF).
- SMF produces only a single straight path for the light, that can travel large distances
- MMF is popular in LANs because it can be powered by low-cost LEDs. The otherside is that only can travel up to 500 meters.
