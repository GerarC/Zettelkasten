# ITNs00B Intermediary Devices

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.2.

## **Quote**
> Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network. They can connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork. These intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.

> Intermediary devices use the destination end device address, in conjunction with information about the network interconnections, to determine the path that messages should take through the network.

> Intermediary network devices perform some or all of these functions:
> - Regenerate and retransmit communication signals
> - Maintain information about what pathways exist through the network and internetwork
> - Notify other devices of errors and communication failures
> - Direct data along alternate pathways when there is a link failure
> - Classify and direct messages according to priorities
> - Permit or deny the flow of data, based on security settings

> **Note:** Not shown is a legacy Ethernet hub. An Ethernet hub is also known as a multiport repeater. Repeaters regenerate and retransmit communication signals. Notice that all intermediary devices perform the function of a repeater.

## **Summary**
There are some devices that connect one or more *End devices* to the network and ensure that data flows across it. These devices are called **Intermediary Devices**.

Intermediary devices use the destination address and information about the *interconnections* to determinate the path that data should take.

An Intermediary device perform some of all of these functions: repeat the signal, have information about existent pathways, notify errors and communication failures, *address data along alternate pathways* if the main link is broken, *Classify and manage data according to priorities* and permit or deny data flow depending on security settings.
