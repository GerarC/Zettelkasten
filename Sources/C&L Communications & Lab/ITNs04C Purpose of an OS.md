# ITNs04C Purpose of an OS

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.1.

## **Quote**
> Network operating systems are similar to a PC operating system. Through a GUI, a PC operating system enables a user to do the following:
> -   Use a mouse to make selections and run programs
> -   Enter text and text-based commands
> -   View output on a monitor

> A CLI-based network operating system (e.g., the Cisco IOS on a switch or router) enables a network technician to do the following:
> -   Use a keyboard to run CLI-based network programs
> -   Use a keyboard to enter text and text-based commands
> -   View output on a monitor

> A switch will forward traffic by default and does not need to be explicitly configured to operate. For example, two configured hosts connected to the same new switch would be able to communicate.

## **Summary**
A Cisco CLI based OS is used for, basically, run programs, configure the system and view outputs in a monitor.
