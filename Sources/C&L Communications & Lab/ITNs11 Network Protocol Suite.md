# ITNs11 Network Protocol Suite

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 3.3.

## **Quote**
## Network Protocol Suites
> In many cases, protocols must be able to work with other protocols so that your online experience gives you everything you need for network communications. Protocol suites are designed to work with each other seamlessly.

> A protocol suite is a group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function.

> One of the best ways to visualize how the protocols within a suite interact is to view the interaction as a stack. A protocol stack shows how the individual protocols within a suite are implemented. The protocols are viewed in terms of layers, with each higher-level service depending on the functionality defined by the protocols shown in the lower levels. The lower layers of the stack are concerned with moving data over the network and providing services to the upper layers, which are focused on the content of the message being sent.

## **Summary**
Network Protocol Suite:
- These suites are made to work seamlessly
- A suite is a group of protocols that are interrelated, used to perform a communication.
- To visualize it you can imagine a protocol stack. where the higher protocols depend on the lower.
- To communicate the highest protocols are focused on the content and the lowest are concerned to move data over the network.
