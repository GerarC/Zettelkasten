# ITNs03C Quality of Service

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.6.

## **Quote**
> Quality of Service (QoS) is an increasing requirement of networks today. New applications available to users over networks, such as voice and live video transmissions, create higher expectations for the quality of the delivered services.

> Congestion occurs when the demand for bandwidth exceeds the amount available. Network bandwidth is measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second, or bits per second (bps). When simultaneous communications are attempted across the network, the demand for network bandwidth can exceed its availability, creating network congestion.

> When the volume of traffic is greater than what can be transported across the network, devices will hold the packets in memory until resources become available to transmit them. In the figure, one user is requesting a web page, and another is on a phone call. With a QoS policy in place, the router can manage the flow of data and voice traffic, giving priority to voice communications if the network experiences congestion.The focus of QoS is to prioritize time-sensitive traffic. The type of traffic, not the content of the traffic, is what is important.

## **Summary**
Sometimes performance of a networks is bad 'cause it is Congest. Congestion occurs when a lot of simultaneous communications are attempted in the network so the demand of bandwidth can exceed the available. When there is congestion devices hold the packets in memory until there is resources to transmit it again. To resolve this problem there is a policy named **Quality of Service** or **QoS**, with QoS the router can manage the flow of data prioritizing the type of traffic, and not the content, and letting flow more important types.
