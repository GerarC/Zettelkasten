# ITNs12 OSI Model

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 3.5.

## **Quote**
> The OSI reference model provides an extensive list of functions and services that can occur at each layer. This type of model provides consistency within all types of network protocols and services by describing what must be done at a particular layer, but not prescribing how it should be accomplished.

> |**OSI Model Layer**|**Description**|
|:--:|:-|
|**7 - Application**|The application layer contains protocols used for process-to-process communications.|
|**6 - Presentation**|The presentation layer provides for common representation of the data transferred between application layer services.|
|**5 - Session**|The session layer provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and to manage data exchange.|
|**4 - Transport**|The transport layer defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices.|
|**3 - Network**|The network layer provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.|
|**2 - Data Link**|The data link layer protocols describe methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media|
|**1 - Physical**|The physical layer protocols describe the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to activate, maintain, and de-activate physical connections for a bit transmission to and from a network device.|

 > [!note] 
 Whereas the TCP/IP model layers are referred to only by name, the seven OSI model layers are more often referred to by number rather than by name.

## **Summary**
OSI Model:
- This model provides a lot of functions and services at each layer.
- this type of model describes what must be done at particular layer, this provides consistency for all the network protocols and services.
- The OSI Model has seven layers, in order are: *Application*, *Presentation*, *Session*, *Transport*, *Network*, *Data Link* and the *Physical* layers.
- Usually the layers are referred by the numbers rather than by name.
