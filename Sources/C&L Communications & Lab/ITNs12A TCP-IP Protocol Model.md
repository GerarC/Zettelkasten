# ITNs12A TCP-IP Protocol Model

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 3.5.

## **Quote**
> The TCP/IP protocol model for internetwork communications was created in the early 1970s and is sometimes referred to as the internet model. This type of model closely matches the structure of a particular protocol suite. The TCP/IP model is a protocol model because it describes the functions that occur at each layer of protocols within the TCP/IP suite. TCP/IP is also used as a reference model.

> |**TCP/IP Model Layer**|**Description**|
|:-|:-:|
|**4 - Application**|Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.|
|**3 - Transport**|Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks.|
|**2 - Internet**|Determines the best path through the network.|
|**1 - Network Access**|Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.|

## **Summary**
<!-- try to apply the method of the question and the answer, if there is more than one idea, then make a single note or sub note from each idea -->
