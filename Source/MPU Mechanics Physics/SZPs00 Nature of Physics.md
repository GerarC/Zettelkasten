## **Quote**
> No theory is ever regarded as the final or ultimate truth. The possibility always exists that new observations will require that a theory be revised or discarded. It is in the nature of physical theory that we can disprove a theory by  finding behavior that is inconsistent with it, but we can never prove that a theory is always correct. *Page 27*

## **Summary**
The Nature of the science is that No theory is the ultimate truth. There will be always the possibility that the pre-established things be replaced by more exact studies.
