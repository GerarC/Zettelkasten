# SZPs03G Relative Velocity

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 3.5.

## **Quote**
> Relative velocity: When a body P moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $B$, and $B$ moves relative to a body (or reference frame) $A$, we denote the velocity of $P$ relative to $B$ by $\vec{v}_{P/B}$, the velocity of $P$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{P/A}$, and the velocity of $B$ relative to $A$ by $\vec{v}_{B/A}$. If these velocities are all along the same line, their components along that line are related by Eq. (3.32). More generally, these velocities are related by Eq.

> $v_{P/A-x} = v_{P/B-x} + v_{B/A-x}$
(relative velocity along a line)

> $\vec{v}_{P/A} = \vec{v}_{P/B} + \vec{v}_{B/A}$
(relative velocity in space)
