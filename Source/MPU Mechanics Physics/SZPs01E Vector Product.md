# SZPs01E Vector Product

## **Reference**
University Physics, Sears and Zemansky; Chapter 1.10.

## **Quote**
> We denote the vector product of two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, also called the cross product, by $\vec{A}\times\vec{B}$. As the name suggests, the vector product is itself a vector.

> $C = AB\sin\phi$
or
$C_x = A_yB_z - A_zB_y \qquad C_y = A_zB_x - A_xB_z \qquad C_z = A_xB_y - A_yB_x$

## **Summary**
<!-- Resume of the idea with the context of the quote. -->
