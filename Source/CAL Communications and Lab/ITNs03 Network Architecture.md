# ITNs03 Network Architecture

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.6.

## **Quote**
> The role of the network has changed from a data-only network to a system that enables the connections of people, devices, and information in a media-rich, converged network environment. For networks to function efficiently and grow in this type of environment, the network must be built upon a standard network architecture.

> Networks also support a wide range of applications and services. They must operate over many different types of cables and devices, which make up the physical infrastructure. The term network architecture, in this context, refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure and the programmed services and rules, or protocols, that move data across the network.

> -   Security

## **Summary**
Nowadays the most of the people rely on networks, that's why networks must be built upon a standard network architecture and have some characteristics such as *Fault Tolerance*, *Scalability*, *QoS* and *Security*.
