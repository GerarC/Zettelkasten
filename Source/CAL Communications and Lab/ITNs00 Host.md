## **Quote**
> All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can be called end devices. Some hosts are also called clients. However, the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number identifies the host within a particular network. This number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

> Servers are computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. Each service requires separate server software. For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network. A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to many different clients.

> The network devices that people are most familiar with are end devices. To distinguish one end device from another, each end device on a network has an address. When an end device initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination end device to specify where to deliver the message.

> An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network.

## **Summary**
**Hosts** or **End Devices** are any computer that is connected to a network and participate on it. A host is either the source and the destination of the message. There are two types of end devices *Client*s and *Server*s, this depends on the type of software is using. For example, a Web Browser is a client software. Host term specifically refers to a device that has a *IP Address*, this address is used to distinguish a End device from another and specify which is the destination of the data.
