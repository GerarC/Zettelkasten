## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 2.4.

## **Quote**
> All networking devices should limit administrative access by securing privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and remote Telnet access with passwords. In addition, all passwords should be encrypted and legal notifications provided.

> When choosing passwords, use strong passwords that are not easily guessed. There are some key points to consider when choosing passwords:
> -   Use passwords that are more than eight characters in length.
> -   Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences.
> -   Avoid using the same password for all devices.
> -   Do not use common words because they are easily guessed.

## **Summary**

A good password must have more than eight chars, use a combination of lower and uppercase letters, number and special chars; and don't use common words. Also you shouldn't use the same password for all devon't use common words. Also you shouldn't use the same password for all devices.
