# ITNs00C Network Media

## **Reference**
Introduction to Networking, Cisco; Lesson 1.2.

## **Quote**
> Communication transmits across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

> Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices, as shown in the figure:
> -   **Metal wires within cables** - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
> -   **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)** - Data is encoded into pulses of light.
> -   **Wireless transmission** - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

> The four main criteria for choosing network media are these:
> - What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
> - What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
> - What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
> - What is the cost of the media and installation?

> Different types of network media have different features and benefits. Not all network media have the same characteristics. Not all media are appropriate for the same purpose. These are some of the differences between various types of media:
>  -   Distance the media can successfully carry a signal
> -   Environment in which the media is to be installed
> -   Amount of data and the speed at which it must be transmitted
> -   Cost of the media and installation

## **Summary**
**Network Media** connects devices between them physically and is the channel over which data travels. 
There are three primary types of media. Metal wires where data is electrical impulses. Glass or plastic fibers where the data is encoded into pulses of light. And the wireless transmission where the data is encoded via electromagnetic wave frequencies.
